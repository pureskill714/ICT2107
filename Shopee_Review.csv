3	Working environment	 Relationship Manager	9 Mar 2023	4.0	It was great experience. Learnt a lot and improve communication skill.	A lot of manual work
4	Shopee biz direction	 Senior Associate	9 Mar 2023	5.0	Team members are hard-working and nice	Biz direction is easy to change and it changes too fast to let teams to follow
5	Can be better	 Key Account Manager	9 Mar 2023	2.0	Colleagues are fun to be with, everybody wants to get their job done	Management should seriously review their priorities and focus - stop policing our attendance when we still get our job done
6	Chill coworkers and manager	 Intern	9 Mar 2023	4.0	- Nice office - coworkers were friendly - good office snacks - no OT - practice communications with different stakeholders	- work can be repetitive - Didn't learn much practical skills
7	Lead a team	 Associate	9 Mar 2023	4.0	fair benefit, clear career path, Casual outfit, start up company	Multi talent job and duty, normatif over time, have to adapt and fast knowledge of product information.
8	Good place to experience tech industry & move after a year	 Human Resources	9 Mar 2023	3.0	- One of the good places to earn e-commerce business portfolios in the tech industry, arguably the best tech company in the country - Pleasant culture. Millennials would love it here due to the relatively small generation gap among the team which affects how people communicate with each other - Good place to build personal branding - Salary, benefits, & perks are competitive vs other tech companies with the same standard (trust me I've interviewed, researched, and hired several people from tech competitors) - Networking. You can work with many great talents, ranging from ex-consultants, to many overseas graduates. Even the freshies are very smart	- No serious implementation for effective talent development & career progression - Workload & expectations for you will be very high on the very first day. Especially high during the campaign period - Related to point number 1 & 2, there's a reason why turnover rates are high. Last time i checked our insight, employees' AVG tenure years is around 1-1.5 years. So might need to think about your next move after your 9th month in the company - For HR readers : The only good HR functions to work with is the recruitment & HRBP, mainly recruitment. The Compben team is quite decent, but for other functions (OD, IR, Talent Management, L&D) honestly rarely heard and people quickly comes & go in there - For HR readers : the experienced HR might be bored after just a month of working here

41	Really good work environment	 Seller Management	6 Mar 2023	4.0	Good work environment: the work environment has allowed everyone to give an opinion to figure out a best solution for a particular problem. Also, everyone is well coordinated in solving a problem even if it doesn't relate to them. Great start for a first jobber: As the majority of employees come from consulting firm, financial industry, and platform companies, you will receive a wide range of skill especially structuring problem and a systematic way to approach solutions which is very important to turn you to be a professional. And you will have an opportunity to do a bunch of data analysis that will shape you in a better understanding in dealing with a great amount of data and data execution.	Manual Execution: Some important task, people have chosen to do the same way manually, instead of find a way to automate the task or take this issue as a serious problem to be solved.

58	Doesn’t listen to employees	 Anonymous Employee	3 Mar 2023	3.0	- Great colleagues/ teammates - Benefits are comparable to other companies (however not competitive annual leaves) - Good pay	- Sr management on HQ side does not listen to employees, we are only a human to keep their pockets full and business running - No transparency from upper management - increased workloads and expectations without official notice or increments to reflect new responsibilities - bad sr management attitude “take it or leave it, you can just leave if you don’t like it” with no outlook on positive changes - unable to see career progression - for a tech company, removing any form of hybrid work arrangement is ridiculous.

222	"Glorify burnouts as ""going above and beyond"" and ""growth opportunity"""	 Project	7 Feb 2023	2.0	"- Extremely fast pace, can learn a lot of things. 

- Workforce is very young, everyone is very friendly and helps each other. Not much office politics at ground level, but in order to climb up people start to play some backstabbing. 

- Work-life balance used to be very very bad, now is relatively okay but still depends on what team you are in."	"- Lack of flexibility, force you to 100% work from office even though your work can 100% be done remotely. 

- There is a system that tracks punch in/out time and sends out weekly attendance reports (with hours present in office) to managers so that they can ""manage your attendance"". 

- Everything is very manual, very messy and very highly prone to human errors which lead to a lot of issues. 

- There can be data lead sidelining project(s) simply because they dislike somebody, in the name of ""lack of resources"". 

- Management laid off manpower that handles manual work AND also the manpower that does automation. So whoever stays have to do everything. LOL. 

- Lack of job security, not a stable industry post-pandemic. Revenue dropping every month due to poor business decisions. 

- Poor benefit, they cut down a lot of benefits and froze salary increment. Nobody cares if you're paid fairly, they only care if they can save cost from you and earn more. 

- Very high attrition rate because people are just overworked and underpaid.  

- Lack of support and direction from middle/senior management. They're just there to present their subordinates' work and check if people come into office."

Huge cultural differences as well, which makes fitting into the team difficult. If you don't follow them, then you're losing out. - Senior management is like ""old boys club"", mostly men and they take care of one another despite poor performance of some managers. They are promoted to middle management due to longevity in the company. - Organisational structure is extremely inefficient, unlikely to change due to political reasons. As a BPM (Business Product Manager), you are working on 20% of the scope that standard PMs in the industry/other big tech companies do, but the workload is huge due to the scale. That was before the mass lay-offs btw. Now I heard its worst. - Messy documentation due to high turnover - Many team leads/managers are not leadership material, even though they may be competent in their work, resulting in a lot of unhappiness and lack of respect honestly. - Doesn't really open doors for other opportunities as PM due to afformentioned narrow scope as a BPM"

484	A sinking ship	 Associate	18 Dec 2022	3.0	+ People are collaborative and it's easy to get help from someone on a different team + Working with similarly-aged peers	"1) Lack of inspiring leadership from middle to senior management. - Management are usually parachuted from other departments without relevant experience (except working for the company). 
-Authoritarian leadership that does not allow room for differing opinions. Many managers have no choice but to execute decisions of senior management. 
- Decisions are often made in a knee-jerk manner, makes you wonder if the Management has any long term vision. E.g. Birthday leave was retracted less than 1 year after roll out; the direction for employees to book a seat via internal app was reversed less than 1 month after roll out.
 - Lack of trust for employees. It wasn't enough to enforce 5 days work from office, this was followed with an attendance tracking system to monitor time in office. 

2) Elitism. Significantly different pay for the same role, depending on whether you are from local or private uni, or the honours class you graduated with. Recruiters ask for education transcripts from 'O' levels to university to benchmark you. 

3) Slave driving culture. You don't get rewarded for volunteering to take on additional scopes but get a below-average performance grade instead.

 4) Cost cutting is now the ultimate priority and done at all expense, including that of the welfare of employees. Welfare and benefits have been severely cut."

-located at one north, quite nice office environment. 
-pantry (albeit has dropped in size and quality)"	"-MANDATORY WORK FROM OFFICE 100% EVERYDAY 

-Attendance tracking (as of 14 Nov) to make sure employees are monitored to the minute. Official stance is attendance won't affect performance and is just to provide managers with ""visibility"" on employees working arrangement. But many can see the BS behind this. Shopee used to have attendance tracking in 2018 and has now reverted to this primitive method. What are we? Blue-collared workers stamping a time sheet? 

-Upper management changing workplace arrangements on a whim. Hot desk system was implemented and significant resources were poured into developing an app for booking tables. Then suddenly came the announcement to go back to 5 day full WFO. Everyone was working fine and delivering their deliverables, why make this useless change? 

- Birthday leave abruptly removed in first half of 2022. 

- many small things will be routed to senior management for approval. I'm pretty sure precious dollars are wasted if directors and whatnot have to manually screen through every application."

4. Reorg very often with outside manager from CNDC, very high TO rate 
5. Manager and leaders from SZ are not qualified, knowing nothing about business but loving to control you everything. Also PUA you and your ex-colleagues. They have more ppl but do fewer things with very low ROI. 
6. Manager and leaders from SZ are very poor at English. They cannot speak even a whole sentence. They just always speak Chinese and don’t respect non-Chinese speakers."
691	Shopee’s best asset is its people - but gurl, it’s not worth staying. Weigh the cons.	 Senior Analyst	12 Nov 2022	4.0	Colleagues are great and fun to work with. Since the majority are early-to-mid-career professionals, they are extremely helpful, receptive of feedback, generous with their knowledge, team player, and the over-all office atmosphere is university-vibe. If lucky, you can build friendships that transcends beyond your days with the company.	- Managers are gaslighters and insensitive - maybe just my personal experience. They don’t know how to respect work-life boundaries and demanding of outputs (most especially during sale season which unfortunately is 3x in a month) even when you’re on leave for health reasons or family matters. Their expectations are way beyond your pay grade like literally and will gaslight you so you would think that you are not enough. They also have a culture of treating people who resigns as betrayers even with full awareness of the reasons why they left. - Promotion is a very rare opportunity. There are too many red tapes in the process. They are using one ruler to all when it shouldn’t be since every role is different. Also, managers are so full of themselves that their standards are astonishingly, unreasonably high when they don’t even have a proper rubric in grading progress. - Recruiters are low-ballers. Even though they have enough budget for your role, they’ll ensure to get you at the very low market price. Hence, the huge discrepancy also in terms of salary range of people with the same job title. - Benefits are BARE MINIMUM. HMO, Transpo allowance, Internet allowance. Other companies in the similar industry provide far better benefits to their employees.

- ??? 

If these two are the only pros in a company (office related amenities), then there is definitely something wrong."	"I've been here less than a month and i've already found a bunch of cons.

1. The mainland culture. 
You'll see a lot of reviews here call out the fact that 90% of the company is from mainland. This is true and think very carefully on whether you want to be in a company like this because your culture might not be compatible at all. Documents, meetings and daily conversations will be in mandarin, and if you're not a native speaker, expect very awkward english conversations where things are lost in translation. This is Singapore, i expected it to be a company with at least majority Singaporeans, i was wrong. 

2. Lack of on-boarding process and guidance
If you're hoping for a smooth transition into the job scope, with managers guiding you? You are very wrong. There is zero guidance, you're expected to find everything and everyone yourself, and with no clear organisational chart and high turnover, you'll start to become super lost and become demotivated within your first week. New positions are being created all the time with zero visibility or communication between management, so you won't even know which department is in charge of what processes. It's EXTREMELY messy.

3. The messiest processes 
NOTHING IS DEFINED AND DOCUMENTED. THERE IS ZERO SOP/CLEAR PROCEDURAL GUIDELINES FOR YOUR TO DO YOUR JOB. Everyone just chucks data/document everywhere, it is not organised at all. There is no defined processes to approach certain tasks so you'll have no idea where/how to start or if what you're doing even makes sense. 

4. Lack of career progression
Before coming in, I believed I would be able to gain some skills for career progression. As it turns out, its the blind leading the blind here. Very vague communication or clear direction on what you're job expectations it and no training whatsoever. It's very unclear what the upward career progression path is. Maybe this is why they hire fresh grads or staff below 30, so everyone is just as equally as lost and won't get progressed? 

5. Job description vs reality of job
Please ignore the messages from recruiters, they are tasked to hire you and will tell you what you want to hear. I've been sweet talked into a job with Shopee, throwing away a perfect good career path and now I'm in the worst possible position. What the recruiters tell you is the JD is probably 50% of the truth, they won't know the full extend of your JD because it is written by your line managers. You'll only find out about your full JD when you start the job, and by then it's too late. Often, your true JD includes MUCH more responsibilities than the JD, with almost impossible tasks for one person. 

6. Treatment of employees
You are a number. Look at the recent articles on how they have rescinded offers, leaving potential employees jobless and stranded! Also, they had decided to exit 4 countries in Latin America OVERNIGHT! Those poor guys in those offices woke up without a job! What kind of a company does that? Tell anyone you work and shopee, and their reaction tells you the full picture.

I ignored all the CLEAR red flags in hopes to find something good, I was dead wrong and now I am paying the price. Do not repeat my mistake."
1120	2 years employee here (Since Intern)	 Senior Business Development Analyst	14 Sep 2022	2.0	"• Prestige
• You'll meet some exceptional people from exceptional educational background
• Office Politics are almost to none in my experience
• You'll experience a lot of growth (if you're asking for it and you're someone willing to go the extra mile and learn initiatively)
• Flexible work arrangement. Currently need 3 days WFO but flexible check in and out time. As long as work is finished.
• Many of your peers and managers are in the similar age bracket so communication is always straight to the point and no BS.
• From my experience work life balance is ok. Nothing exceptional but it's not bad as well.
• Usually a great place when you're an experienced person before as this company would willing to give you more."	"1. If you're a fresh graduate. Completely avoid this company as the only job available for you will be manual, repetitive, and usually administrative. Unless you're coming from an Ivy League tier Uni in indo or overseas.
2. Born as a startup you'll feel the fast paced environment. But a lot of the things have no direction or as in PM world a North Star Metrics. So every initiative sound nice, but actually doesn't work as intended 80% of the time.
3. You'll witness a lot of your friends resigning as I witness more than 10+ of my friends already left the company. With sometime more than 3 person left the team in a month,

I have witnessed an inequality, that I cannot accept to know. As someone who's been at the company since 2020. It was a pretty memorable journey for me. But, I have just discovered that a new joiner that was previously an Intern for less than 3 months were converted to full-time with compensation 18% better than me and my peers with the same responsibilities, and the same rank. You will not be valued based on your value. Only God knows what measurement they use to value your work."

low salary increase, if you get a high score on the assessment, they'll make sure to lower your scores so you don't get what you deserve. I'm sure of this because our leads have to fight for a decent increase
they don't promote, they hire managers externally resulting to constant changes and inconsistencies in standards and processes.
To add, each team, each department have their own system - Shopee won't invest in automated software because of cost cutting. Even time in and time outs are done in sheets, EVERYTHING is done in sheets. My previous work at a start up agency is even more automated"

- organisational structure is SUPER messy 
(a lot of duplicate departments and positions, which probably explains why they are retrenching people and rescinding offers now)

- hiring is still discriminatory 
(try joining if you are not chinese or not from local u) 

- management is training staff to be delusional 
(they will tell you that company is doing well while you are reading news about shopee retrenching people and rescinding offer outside / they will tell you that work is dynamic when it's really just messy)

- to them, you are just a number
(look at how they retracted the offer from someone who just landed at the airport with his wife / look at how many people stay past 1 year / look at all the news about this company) 

My friends, the red flags are waving. Don't ignore them just because the tech industry is sexy. Your career and your livelihood is at stake. Look somewhere else."

+ Pay and benefits was good while it lasted"	"+ Very high amount of visible nepotism - with the C-Suite place their wife, school friends, college friends (most of them are utterly incapable), etc. at all critical roles
+ Works very much like a Chinese family-run business - if you are not Chinese and part of the 'close family' absolutely cannot grow into senior roles
+ Tries to be very analytical on paper, but most of the decisions are taken top down based on the feelings of a couple of people in the C-Suite. This has resulted in us expanding to a lot of markets, hiring people, and then laying them off.
+ Roles are still not defined despite a 60k large team size. Always still feels that multiple people are doing the same job - with expectations that they will fight among each other and one of them will come up with the answer."

- No work life balance, expect to receive messages even at 4am

No comcrete direction- just doing what we need to do day by day , without understanding the full picture"

- Get to experience reality TV in the flesh: Every CEO meeting (ranges from bi-weekly to monthly) is like an episode of Fear Factor. The leads are in terror of presenting even though every outcome is the same: Not good enough to meet CEO's standards

- Unlimited opportunities to take responsibility since everything is blamed on middle management and junior staff by senior management

- Countless negative demonstrations of how NOT to be a manager as demonstrated by ""Yes-sir"" senior management who only grovel to what CEO - Chris dictates and collectively have absolute disregard for employee well being

- Builds your resilience: From verbal abuse to unrealistic targets / deadlines. If you believe in ""what doesn't kill me, makes me stronger"" this place certainly makes you stronger - after you have been brutally destroyed a few times each month

- Limitless learning opportunities: Everything is a complete mess so anywhere you look you will have loads to learn! Only real plus side is the middle to junior staff are amazing in trying to help you figure things out!"	"- Horrible work-life with no professional respect for personal time ranging from late night calls to working over public holidays, weekends and leave. Their manager values handbook personally curated by CEO Chris Feng even spells out in black and white for the value We Commit ""Make personal sacrifices for the good of the organisation""

- Very inexperienced people managers in senior leadership (mainly junior people who joined the company when it first started and got promoted to the top) They have no idea how to grow / retain talent and firmly believe in churn

- Disastrous tone from the top which advocates all these negative behaviours in the organisation. The company is trying to make some changes since the last PR disaster but these changes are being enforced at the middle management level but not the top. Hence the churn experienced at middle management."

In their eyes, Team Assistants are not full-time employees like the associates; rather, we are merely individuals who can only follow their instructions and complete the assigned tasks because our job title is TEAM assistant. There are coworkers who receive assignments that were not disclosed to them before the interview, for instance, completing marketing-related tasks rather than financial ones. If you expect there to be a career progression for TAs, forget about it. In Shopee, there is no such thing as seniority; anyone who join later than you but with a higher rank (ie. associate) is still your ""boss"" and you have to listen to their instruction, and you are just their personal excel helper to them even though you join earlier. TA are not involved in any of the discussion associates have, and are only communicated to when we ask them. Not to mention, no one bother to talk to an intern in the team and unless the intern is helping them, they don't care about the intern's existence at all. All in all, a very unhappy experience in shopee."

1365	Everything is urgent in Shopee, impossible to focus	 Operations	28 Jul 2022	4.0	"- People that Shopee hires are generally capable people & are really good in what they do
- People are nice, collaborative & willing to help each other 
- People are go-getters (everyone works hard to get the work done)
- Shopee has a good brand name
- Always running initiatives to continue to improve 
- Allows casual wear
- Office is located in a nice mall with many food choices around
- Yearly increment is slightly better than other more traditional companies"	"- There is a lack of focus in Shopee as everything is considered Priority 1 in the eyes of management
- When everything is urgent, it is hard to focus on one thing and do it well, because everyone is stretched across so many initiatives, projects & tasks (so we end up giving mediocre performance in each task)
- Before you can finish your work, you will get several more tasks/ initiatives piled onto your plate (this results in a never ending backlog of TO-DO's, that just snowballs until you are so overwhelmed / have constant anxiety attacks - Sometimes the anxiety gets too much, I can't even focus on doing the work)
- Management always think that everything is easy to do & can be done in 1 day/ 1 week, but they underestimate the amount of work required. Often we are forced to squeeze our timelines into shorter time frames just to 'show results faster' even if it means working late nights every day
- Due to the stressful pace, people leave at a faster rate than we can even complete the work (which results in a lot of time wasted to train new joiners - perhaps management should focus on retention & avoid attrition in the first place to avoid losing all the knowledge)"

1397	OT Culture	 Anonymous Employee	24 Jul 2022	3.0	Big company, Big team, Good mix of job exposures	"Too much OT
Not organized structure"
1398	Different work environment	 Product Manager	23 Jul 2022	1.0	"1) There is little politics at the working level
2) Starting pay for fresh grads is slightly higher than industry average"	"1) There is no org chart shared within the organisation, which makes it extremely difficult to find the right department or right team to collaborate with/ask questions. In addition, it’s difficult to grasp how different teams should work with each other 
2) Due to the nature of the industry, the company adopts a growth mindset - which can also translate to building more tech architectures that is overtly complex, having too many systems, and having overlaps. It is extremely difficult to understand how current systems work 
3) It is a known fact that Shopee is a Chinese-majority company. If you’re not fluent, you’ll stick out like a sore thumb, or have difficulty understanding documents documented in Chinese. Google translate does help sometimes, but more often than not, things do get lost in translation. The Chinese culture does permeate into organisational culture as well - for eg, little flexibility/autonomy or having strict lunch times. It ultimately boils down to whether you can adapt or not.
4) There is little or no career progression, unless you’re one the pioneer batch. There’s no growth plan in place. Management appears to be offended when you ask the question about potential career growth opportunities. 
5) The company is generally made up of a young demographic, with a huge portion under 30 or fresh grads. Young people are capable too and full of drive and energy. But it does tell you why about the organisation’s strategy on talent development/talent retention. The attrition rate is high and average benchmark of people staying is 1-2 years. Leave? No problem, they’ll throw money to hire new young people. You’re nothing more than a cog in the system."
1399	Enthusiastic company	 Marketing Associate	23 Jul 2022	3.0	Clean office. Decent pantry. There's assurance that your opinion matters and someone to reach out to if you need support work/welfare wise.	"Explorative culture for time-sensitive adults. You might feel a lot of time and effort wasted. 

 Incessant need to ask questions to show you understand what's going on, which is unfair to some people (eg. those who experience sensory overload, introverts, need more time to digest info).

The push for WFO is not a conductive idea for many. My heart goes out to employees with dependants, those who live far away from office and also those who are inevitably forced into being productive at the same standard time as everyone."

Relevance - exposure and impact that comes from working at the largest ecommerce company in southeast Asia"	"Toxic culture:

1. Lack of trust and ownership on associates and mid-management, hence the constant occurrence of top-down micromanagement from the same set of OG senior leaders

2.HR is not setup for success: unable to disagree with senior leadership and be truly objective. 

3. Lack of diversity: C-level (and most of the directors) remains the same demographic: middle-aged straight Chinese Males. Unable to gain input and fully empathize with those of other gender, age, race, background, and sexual orientation."

1483	Think Twice	 Senior Associate	12 Jul 2022	1.0	Pantry well stocked with drinks, free dinner if work late	"1. The company is very unoptimized with a lot of duplicated work or positions created because the roles cross functionally are just not clear or not clearly followed. There are many layers created which are not required, example having personnel doing similar work from different departments. The worst part is each layer is just passing work around, which usually ends up with the core business team because impact is felt directly there
Take for instance:
- Business team doing product related work , filling their gaps when work should be filled in the other side. No actions is taken to ensure the right PIC does the work
- PIC / Team created within the business just because no one is aware of how other departments can or SHOULD value add 

2. Feedback is like talking to walls, because ultimately management only cares for themselves - you can give how much feedback to improve the way of working with other department but boss will not care because they do not think it is important to them, despite the fact that changes can only be done by them

3. Do not value your personal growth at all. Back to point 2, feedback about growth or opportunities is redundant because no one cares

4. Tend to hire overly qualified people to take on roles"

1534	Bad	 	3 Jul 2022	1.0	interviewing process was fast and smooth	"I left within a month.

1. Do not expect mentorship

Entered under the fresh graduate scheme but was treated as an experienced worker. Was overloaded with 10+ projects in my 2nd week without having proper onboarding and understanding. Fast forward to 3rd week, 20 projects. Colleague who was supposed to mentor and guide me, asked one of the intern to guide me what to do (intern was new as well). My team mates from the orientation camp asked me why do I have meetings during orientation. 

2. Whether the project is feasible or not, manager will expect you to churn it. Do not ask why.

For some of the  projects, I did ask what is the potential value of doing it - manager disregarded and told me to just do without explaining the potential impact. It was due to the pressure from the top - our dept requires higher target.

3. Exit Interview

During the exit interview, the interviewer was extremely condescending - perhaps she thinks that this is Google or Meta. Not too sure how many good reviews were implanted by their internal team.

All in all, this place does not promote career development, no mentorship and employs a high percentage of foreign talent. Company processes are very inefficient too.

There are many companies that value your skills and talent - be wise in choosing. Do not forsake your mental health. Ask yourself what sort of impact you want to be working on - or perhaps just adding a button at the shopping cart?"

Goodies, free gift boxes during campaign days.
Have fund for team bonding. 
Flexi work arrangement but now have to wfo at least 3 days."	"Lack of trust to people with external experience. Experienced people are singled out and not trusted, its quite interesting they headhunted you to join the firm but don't trust you to do your job. 

Chinese culture, likes to hire people from China. Look at their people on LinkedIn and see how many Chinese there, many have no international experience before Shopee. 

A tech firm that has little innovation, always copy from others including own internal policies making, often time ask people to gather intel on competitors and copy competitors instead of be creative and lead change in market. 

Keeps promoting start up culture although the firm is so big now, solving issues by hiring more people creating conflicts and confusions among people."

1630	Strong headwinds ahead	 Manager	15 Jun 2022	3.0	"- Abundant growth opportunities
- Decent compensation (sans shares)

Was a good run while it lasted"	"1) Bad business planning and lack of viable strategy
- Infighting between teams over resources and pointing fingers instead of thinking for the collective good of the company
- ""Strategy reviews"" or ""roadmap planning"" looks good on the presentation, but if you look at the details there are many loopholes/gaps and poorly executed
- Lack of strategic planning for long term when many teams are merely playing catchup or daily fire fighting, meaning capacity/capability/resources are always lagging behind business and needs (e.g. always need to OT, sacrifice weekends, always something ""urgent"" when on leave, burnout, lack of manpower & headcount just to name tip of iceberg)
- Systems capabilities far lagging and deprioritized - company does not invest in proper work tools and systems required for teams to work efficiently/effectively, require manual tracking/record/process that is struggling to support biz expansion/volume growth sustainably. incredibly alarming when you have a company so colossal (systems, people, processes, businesses) but still running on a startup infrastructure (e.g. imagine 48k employees and no org chart)

2) Weak leadership 
- Most of the senior leadership are experienced, resourceful and capable, but you are only as strong as your weakest link. Some questionable leaders in strategic positions that are not making the best decisions in the interest of the company's long term growth, but only looking at short term needs and performance so that they can aim for promotion
- Senior leaders not in touch with the ground/""reality"",  making a show of asking for ""feedback"" (e.g. townhalls, pulse checks, engagement surveys) but when feedback is given nothing is actually done to address the issues, after a while people just dont bother giving real feedback anymore cos whats the point right
- Many middle managers are promoted/asked to ""step up"" too quickly, even before they are ready to lead teams e.g. when open a new market in a new country, parachute a high level exec there to be country manager, but you need someone to takeover this exec's portfolio, so everyone down the chain is asked to ""step up"" and ""take on more things"" even before they are ready or demonstrated they are capable to do so. some have zero experience grooming/leading/developing teams, resulting in poor direction and (lack of) leadership
- HR programs to ""train new leaders"" not effective when middle managers are already so overworked, barely even have time to eat and sleep much less attend training programs
- pattern of favoring/hiring ""consultants"" is struggling to payoff 

3) Lip service to people/talent development
- company does alot of PR and marketing about developing talents but most of this is just paying lip service/only for public show everything looks great on the outside
- true that you get many opportunities to explore diff parts of the businesses because shopee is growing so quickly and there's always new initiatives/projects, but how supportive your manager is of your exploring these opportunities is a whole diff pic. 
- a lot of managers are under immense pressure from higher up to breakeven, demonstrate growth and take on more projects, they barely have time to slow down and guide/plan for their team's career growth and development
- HR trying its best to do ""L&D"" programs, but this wont work without actual, supportive buy-in from senior leaders. many leaders dont even engage or participate in their own team's team development/engagement workshop because ""too busy""/""back to back to back to back meetings"""

- Benefits other than base salary are just okay"	"- Senior management literally do not care about overall wellbeing of employees as well as overall career growth. Instead of promoting high-performing internal talents, would rather hire imports who have little to no knowledge about the local market and can tend to dehumanize the workplace
- No concrete growth plans for current hires, can restructure accounts and job roles with little notice and without any dialogue beforehand with employees
-Work processes for a tech company are highly unoptimized and still prone to technical errors which lead to even more stress internally; processes which are half baked when implemented on a company-wide scale
- Middle management is hit-or-miss, while some leads are good/okay, there are instances wherein they do not take criticism nor actually lead the team and instead choose to play the blame game and scapegoat lower ranking employees
- Work load is too much to handle for one person, often times. Even without a slide shift people tend to overtime at an almost daily basis in order to fit the amount of work in.
- While in the initial offer, it may look a lot, salary is low when compared to the actual workload assigned per person

1692	NSFW	 Associate Product Manager	6 Jun 2022	2.0	Great entry ground for fresh grads, but that’s it. Only come if you want a springboard into tech/big tech, and a higher than average salary.	"This one needs a list, which sadly isn’t exhaustive. 

1. Poor leadership: Management is very reactive and makes decisions to solve problems without really realising the implications to other existing problems and/or creation of new problems. This results in a lot of restructure and change in leadership every few months. New leaders tend to be parachuted to lead new teams that they have 0 expertise or background knowledge in. They also tend to be Chinese nationals. 
2. Increased job insecurity: Many product functions have been moved or are slowly moving to China, with previous Singapore-based PMs being given the ultimatum to join or have to leave. Management cite cost cutting as a reason. This + next point
3. Lack of transparency: Management doesn’t share long term plans for the company, so employees are left in the dark a lot. This makes job security an even greater concern. 
4. Lack of empathy: Unhappiness has been rife with the rising inflation, falling stock prices and general poor welfare and morale. Management holds QnAs, pretending to address low morale but it’s really all for show. Most of the time when confronted with real problems that their employees are facing, they become philosophists saying that happiness should come from within. 
5. Poor culture: Shopee has amazing people but I’ve had my fair share of weird, unprofessional encounters and being insulted very often. Some teams here aren’t close and people are too demoralised or emotionally dead to care enough to make friends."

2. Great environment where people are willing to help."	"1. Lots of OT, had to work even on day offs and occasionally attend meetings and this is not compensated. 

2. Had a terrible boss - micromanages, demeaning, rude, disrespectful, not open to ideas (their way or highway). Raises their voice at you when in a bad mood, or when things don't go their way. Does not take no for an answer. Lied to us a few times just to get what they want.

Note: I had other reporting managers before this one, and the others are nothing like this, they were supportive and there to guide you. And we have raised this issue many times over many months, but nothing was done.

3. Workload is manual and repetitive. It can be very heavy as there's always new initiatives and campaigns to work through which can lead to burnout."

- good place to kickstart your career
- competitive starting salary package with decent annual increment
- like minded individuals promote fun and collaborative team culture"	"- annual increments basically just match fresh grads' salary, meaning a fresh grad with 0 yrs of experience gets the same salary package as someone who has joined for years in the company
- the only way to get a higher salary would be to gun for a promotion, but levelling is significantly unclear especially now that the company is expanding rapidly. For an associate to reach senior associate, a new requirement of min 3 working years of experience is set by the company. However, managers claim that it can be reviewed on a case by case basis. However when the topic of promotion is raised, managers typically dodge the question and don't really set clear expectations on how we can achieve it. Even asking odd questions like ""why do you want a promotion so badly? Is it because of money?"" 
- toxic management culture when it comes to evaluating performance, comparing people from different scope and team to make a statement just does not make any sense"

I am local and joined shopee w 3 years of experience.

This place is filled with (young) china talents, and for them to apply EP, the salary needs to be more than 4.5k. And as a local w 3 yr exp, local uni grad , 2nd upper, I get paid way less. 

I chanced upon a post that they hired a China fresh grad (in china relocating to sg) with no experience. And she is applying for EP, meaning salary 4.5k and above. And there were SO SO many of foreign talents there. So most likely the china talent in shopee may be more well paid than you.

Think twice, if u want to work for a company that value foreign talent and pay them much more compared with local with experience.

I wonder how they can hire so many foreign talents."

I don't see any benefits sustaining for long as the company grows. Used to have TWG teabags at pantries, now there's only cheap cheap ones. 

Diminished corporate insurance benefits to minimal level so that they can.

Claiming is getting super difficult now comparing to 3 years ago. 

Don't believe what they boost about the infrastructure-gym in office, sleeping pods, massage rooms-these are just for photo-taking when visitors come. What we have in reality is: bosses will spy on you and complain that you used gym too often; sleeping pods are kept shut doing the pandemic; massage room is only subjected to online booking with very limited quota per employee, and by the end of 2021 the earliest slot you can get on the booking system is only in 2023. These benefits are what they used to lure you in, once you are in, it's a different story. 

Workplace culture wise:

Very toxic culture where you won't stay long if you don't speak and understand mandarin. It's a shame that they claim to be a ""Singapore registered, NYSE listed international company"" that has more than 80% of employee are native Chinese speakers. Almost all internal meetings are conducted in Mandarin Chinese unless there's a non-Chinese speaker presented, and that's where they all start to struggle to expression their opinions and ideas. The problem is they are not proactively willing to adapt to English speaking culture. 

When there's an achievement, bosses and leads will take all the credits; when something nasty during the project execution happens, they start to point fingers level-by-level downwards. 

Workplace skills wise:

People come to work to create product that make business revenue possible, and taking away their wage and skills learned at work as the other side of the equation. In Shopee, the skills you learned at work would be minimal, as there's not enough room or resources to gain skills. Your boss may only ask you to get things done, without you even understanding how it was done, or why it was done in that way. What you were told to do is only to copy what others have been doing from the past. If you question out of curiosity, you will be told to not waste time on such questioning and focus on repetitive work. As designers the nature of the job should be constantly questioning ""what"", ""how"" and ""why""-a product will only improve if we constantly asking such questions and trying to find out the answers. Without these, you are merely doing what you were told to do, and not having the opportunity to learn design critique skills."

2. Nice working working environment with young & energetic colleagues"	"1. No work life balance, need to have the strong heart to survive under the ‘OT culture’, very common to get called during weekends, after working hours. Upper management appreciate  those “workaholics” a lot. Hard to get promoted if you are not the “like minded” no matter how creative/ innovative you are.

2. Lack of diversity, more Chinese ppl surrounded, good if it is your mother tongue otherwise pls get prepared to feel embarrassed from time to time. Meeting can be held in Chinese while some attendees CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL! 

3. High turn over rate and get prepared if your pay is upside down by fresh graduates as heard EP benchmark is keep rising."

They have no idea what they'r doing since the turn over rate in HR team is so high. The team did a bad job onboarding, lost my contract, didn't follow up on the first week to checkin, no communication at all. They change people so often I don't even know who to ask about company policies. On the first day I was shown an out of date presentation without any structural, who to talk to so I can do my job, what's my scope,.. etc 

- Cultural is all for banner and stickers, they dont' actually implement it. 

- Internal process is a mess, too many long meetings, everything is stored in chat and excel ( chinese style) no jira, confluence, what soever. 

- No matter how much the CEO try to patch it, this is a chinese company, doesn't matter if headquater is at or branded as Singapore. It's a chinese company. 

On the first meeting with CEO, he said to everyone in virtual meeting: If you don't like the cultural, don't be here

2244	Exceptional Place	 Anonymous Employee	1 Mar 2022	5.0	To my surprise, Shopee is a really great place to work at. The energy is so vibrant and everyone is super collaborative, positive, passionate, and creative.

The work from home arrangement is definitely a plus point, too. I hope this arrangement will continue to be an option as it is proven workable.	Honestly, nothing I can think of.

Great employee welfare (non-monetary)."	"Struggling for profitability. Increment getting lesser than previous years. Pay for existing hires dont rise as fast while new hires without experience get paid much higher due to wage floor policy (referring to SG's EP minimum wage policy).

Management has a hard-on for ex-consultants/MBAs to take on middle management roles. Starting to turn into a paper-pushing company rather than the startup, all hands on deck culture a few years back. Many middle managers are clueless when it comes to career development of their subordinates and try to avoid making tough decisions, preferring to defer upwards."

- you will need interest in IT to grow/stay long term
- alot of self-learning is involved
- task by task basis with timelines. First 3 months will struggle, after finding that balance, it will turn out fine.
- you will need to learn how to not put too much pressure on yourself; if you have already given your best but still can't complete task, have the courage to ask for time extension or reason it out instead of trying to maintain frontal facade of 'I am independent' and OTing. Depends on individual."

And many more!"	"1. People tend to use direct messaging instead of sending emails when following up requests.
2. ""Meetings culture"" - it sometimes interrupt work momentum
3. Company is not that organized/stable yet despite being 5-6 years already in the industry.
4. A lot of teams are still doing manual work. Company not investing yet to other tech resources that would further alleviate manual work.
5. PH needs to invest more with tech team to help with #4.
6. . High attrition rate probably because of #3 and #4. Root of all employees' problems is the system itself.
7. No Christmas bonus given to employees last Dec 2021 despite higher revenue
8. Shopee riders are not properly compensated and are often taken for granted. They deserve higher salary and proper employee benefits too!

Pay grade isn’t that competing at all unless you’re hired as a Software Engineer or overseas hire.

2571	Good for those who can't find something else	 Senior Associate	2 Jan 2022	2.0	"1. Get to work on interesting projects. The projects I was given had quite high visibility so I have access to senior stakeholders. You might have a better chance at promotion if people in power know you. There are colleagues in other teams that really connect to the purpose of serving the underserved.

2. Strong feedback culture . This is unheard of in other teams but my team was asked to do deep reflections and then to give each other feedback in a group setting. I find it useful even though it's time-consuming and I imagine this can be quite daunting since it's quite confrontational. However, this can help to uncover your own blind spots and weaknesses faster, and people in your team hold you accountable. It's up to you to decide if this is good or bad."	"1. Unclear direction from management . While my manager was reasonably competent, the level above her is simply not. She provided no sense of where the team should be headed and all she wants to do is to follow what other companies are doing. Be original! The team once spent a few meetings discussing an insignificant agenda with no outcome, actually she herself also doesn't know what she wants. In one of the town halls, the management even said that employees should be prepared to sacrifice in the short term i.e. work longer hours, no personal time, for long term growth.

Do note that a lot of the managers are junior because this is their first job and are rewarded for their loyalty. Promotion is based on tenure. You can have about 10 years of experience and be reporting to someone with half of that. This means they have no experience leading teams or what to do. What they can add to you is probably to tell you what the CEO or this particular senior management thinks.

2. Don't expect to be coddled. Especially for mid-career hires, you will be squeezed dry and quickly burn out because:

-The priorities are always changing so you might need to redo everything from scratch. Specifically for my team, the HOD only believes what other people say even though she hired me to do the job. 

-No one will be free to talk to you. Everything here is about execution and fire fighting. If you are new, either swim or drown. 

-Figure out who the stakeholders you need to talk to yourself. There is NO organization chart . The reason given was that the teams are always re-organizing but we know that it's actually because of the high attrition. Employees are asked when posting on LinkedIn to censor the names and prevent tagging other employees as it gives a sense of the structure. Other tech companies are poaching actively. Even big companies have organization charts so I'm not really sure why the secrecy.

3. Overall lack of transparency. Similar to the org chart point, when the recent saga online, employees only received an email addressing this about 1 week after. Until the point I left, there was no news on what the outcomes of the investigation were. Disappointing!"

2609	Probably the worst company I've worked for so far. So many promises of growth, all unmet.	 Associate Product Manager	20 Dec 2021	1.0	"If you come from a High paying job with an FMCG or a Multinational, they'll offer you higher.

Max 20% Increase for non promotions with ""good performance"" (no metrics for this). Y-O-Y."	"There are a lot.

1. Compensation is based on previous work and not proportional to responsibilities given. Example, for 2 people in the same position and rank, one can get paid more than twice the other person for the same responsibilities and scope just because they came from a bigger company with better previous pay. Understandable to a certain point, but the disparity will never be closed regardless of how the lower paid employee performs.

2. Management is disconnected to those in the Assistant manager and lower roles. They push the lower ranks to perform with promises that it will be good for their career growth and advise them that taking on more work is truly the way to advance their careers but truth be told, it will still be a matter of politics usually controlled by middle management. 

3. Career progression is very vague. There are no timelines for career progression and there are no clear career paths. Even for lateral transfers to more crucial roles, there are no increases.

4. Onboarding for certain roles is rushed. Setting up employees for failure.

5. HR is not transparent with their documents.

6. There are no clear metrics on how employees are graded for their KPIs and their bonuses for yearly increases and yearly bonuses. HR does not share this.

7. Employees Bonuses are based on Previous Years performance but are only eligible for employees that are currently with the company, if you resign before they are paid out, no bonuses at all.

8. Local Hires can only grow to a certain point. Management are all expats.

9. There is no such thing as rest and Associates and above ranked cannot file for Overtime Pay."

I think the cons would be my role specifically. I dont think I am learning as much in my role. Since Shopee PH is a big company, it can hire several people to do different tasks: analytics, project management, coding etc. Unlike in a small company where you will really stretch yourself because you have to do several tasks.

2642	A BIG NO. TOXIC CULTURE.	 Product Management	10 Dec 2021	2.0	"You get to do a lot of projects.
That's the only benefit I see from Shopee.
Colleagues are nice (most of them, cause they're still young kids)"	"I don't know where to start the cons. I probably can write for 100,000 words, or even more. I regretted picking this offer and stayed there for more than one year. I already left the job several months ago --- but my body is not healthy anymore (caused by OT)... insomnia and depression are still following me.

You can come if you have an MBA degree or you've worked for those ""big names"" that the company likes. 
This company tends to value MBA, so they hired a lot of MBAs, and these MBAs have a high chance to be your manager. So, good luck :) 
There're a lot of first-time managers in the company; the opportunity to get a good manager is 1/10. If you're a fresh grad, please, take those better companies and then jump after several years. It's too hard for fresh kids to know how to escape from abusive bosses.

Fun facts:
。EVERYONE NEEDS TO OT, ESPECIALLY SEAMONEY. DON""T BELIEVE HR's WLB WORDS. 
。You need to OT to show you're ""valuable"" to them. They will tell you they reward ""hard-working"" colleagues. DON""T OT AT HOME, cause your boss won't care :) If you want to show them you're hard-working, DO IT IN THE OFFICE. Otherwise, no one will value you. ----- THIS IS HOW TOXIC THE CULTURE IS.
。When you escalate your boss's issue to your boss's boss, most of the time, you'll get ignored. Cause they want you to ""TRY HARDER"". And they'll also tell you you're just whining --- no one cares how you feel.
。Don't think work more you'll get more rewards. It's not for PM. It's for devs. There's no clear KPI or OKR for PMs at Shopee. So if you don't know how to bluff, just don't OT, go home at 7, cause no matter how you work, you'll get the same amount --- there's nothing for them to estimate your performance, everything is by impression or boss's GUT FEELING.
。They solve issue by removing those people who creates the issue.
。NO STRUCTURE AND DIRECTION. Everything comes from the big boss. PMs are just executing machines.
。If you can't speak Chinese, avoid this place. I'm serious.
。No one will give you positive feedback. They'll only give this to you when you are about to leave the company.
。No career opportunity or progression. Everything is unclear. Same, they'll only give you hope for career progression when you're about to leave.
。Worked with Shopee's China team and they laughed at my Chinese accent, kept saying they don't understand. While at the same time THEY CAN""T SPEAK ENGLISH.
。Compensations and benefits are the worst among all tech companies. 

There're more. Probably time to write an article about my unhappy career at Shopee. Anyway, if you want more money, go to ByteDance, if you want culture, just leave Singapore, if you want to be healthy, go to European companies. Shopee has nothing but A LOT OF PROJECTS to do."
2643	Overall good	 Data Analyst	10 Dec 2021	4.0	"diversity learning opportunity
company has potential to grow big"	"fast paced
little work life balance"
2644	Fast paced & change is constant. Be mentally prepared before joining	 Senior Associate	9 Dec 2021	3.0	Great place to learn and absorb things because it's a fast paced environment and processes are manual & messy. But because it is a fast paced environment and the processes are manual and messy, it forces an individual to be good in their job and to be able to work well under pressure. Change is also constant in this environment. The environment can make or break you. Good benefits, great office and decent salary	Processes are too manual and messy and this makes it harder to work in such a fast paced environment. Demanding working hours. Little to no work life balance unless you are willing to dwell completely into the job. Actual work is different from the job description. Not a place where I would recommend anyone to work long term because the environment can mentally drain a person and burnt out will happen from time to time. So being mentally prepared before joining the company and this helps an individual to stay in the company

2658	Not only discrimination, but also power abuse	 Technical Recruiter	7 Dec 2021	1.0	good facilities eg. gym, snack, wlb etc	"If you don't agree this company's value, please do not join. 

HR team is abusing its power in recruitment. The expansion of talent base in Mainland China like O2O business in Shanghai and Short Video business in Beijing gives the opportunities for HR team's abusement in power, eg. get rebates from headhunter companies is not a secret. 

Apart from that, the high referral fee(up to 5k+ SGD) motivates the employee to refer friends to join Shopee is also used by HR recruitment team, some of the recruiters find a partner in the company and pass the candidate they should hire by themselves to the partner for them to refer, and share the referral fee.

This is not a single case, but the corner of the iceberg. If a company is bragging itself for good benefit(gym, snack, wlb etc), but messing up in management to cause the discrimination happening everywhere in the company, shall we still call it a good employer? or it's only a money machine faking itself as financial market darling?"

2682	We Commit - into making your life like hell	 Associate	30 Nov 2021	1.0	None? Unless you're so poor to even afford your own snacks then sure, the fully stocked pantry is a plus.	"Do you know what you get when you have a ton of wrong people for the job? Problems. 

Their so-called HR department are filled with people with little to zero HR experience. People that come from non-related work background can come into Shopee and become a HRBP or do some policy related rubbish. Go have a look at the profile of employees they have in their HR roles, you'll get what I mean. 

Experienced hires are made to report to junior staff (by this I mean all the fresh grads they hire). Work processes are a joke and if you raise a concern, pray hard your manager isn't the type to gaslight people. 

All the comments about this being a Chinese company, it's true. Sometimes I wondered if I was working in China. 

They talk about creativity, diversity, inclusion - all the pop words in employment. But its merely lip service. There's no celebration of individuality here. Everything is according to ""what Chris likes"". 

This place is a literal sweatshop. Unless you want to sign your life away to Shopee, avoid at all costs. Shopee expects you to go above and beyond for them but when something happens, they shun you. 

And you know why everything seems rosy on the inside? That is because they don't bother finding out why their turnover rate is so high. Neither do they take employees feedback seriously - they stuff you silly with campaign merchandises instead of addressing issues.

Payroll is also a joke. A leaver has to send over 6 follow up emails before they get 1 reply."

2690	Decent company	 Marketing Associate	29 Nov 2021	4.0	Good employee benefits and initiatives	Frosty management, lacking company spirit
2691	Messy company	 Anonymous Employee	28 Nov 2021	2.0	Good snacks, good pay. Great place to learn about e-commerce. A lot of responsibility upfront.	"1. Young, inexperienced, (sometimes arrogant) managers that were just lucky to be hired in the early days of Shopee and are now entrenched there. Many recent hires are from great companies with a lot of experience to bring to the table but are forced to follow how things are done instead of bringing improvements.

2. No concept of boundaries. You are expected to prioritise the company above everything. Senior management openly calls for 'work-life integration' instead of work-life balance. People who cannot keep up are viewed as not a good fit for the company. It's not even a big deal when people resign anymore.

3. Wasted effort with multiple departments doing duplicate work because CEO will say something and multiple teams will jump on it without clarifying. Every one rushing to make decks for the CEO instead of doing real work. 

4. People are paid according to their education not the amount of work they do. Someone from private uni can be doing the same or more work than a local grad and be paid much less. Senior management can also be openly condescending to those from private uni background. It gets better after a while, but starting point is very uneven. 

5. Lack of coaching. Management actively hires a lot of fresh grads but gets frustrated when they need time to ramp up or cannot cope with some of the work thrown at them. Feedback is given in a very rude and public way. 

Also, some of these positive reviews are obviously fake. There are many 5 star reviews with not much elaboration."

2693	Hostile working environment (Brand and Growth)	 Senior Associate	28 Nov 2021	1.0	"Depending on function and role, it could offer you an opportunity to be autonomous and drive business impact

Pragmatism rules - if you have a suggestion that is good for the business, it can be driven forward quite easily

Can be quite a lot of objectivity as at the lower levels, decisions made are very data driven"	"Onboarding is horrible - As a new joiner manager told me to talk to a list of people to find out what my portfolio is going to be about. Processes are not documented at all and there's a very steep learning curve that organization doesn't help you with, then your performance is not reviewed positively. 

Chaotic collaboration - often have to collaborate with other teams, no clear SOP, no clear sense of prioritizing of incoming requests or to hold other teams accountable to timelines. A lot of internal frictions where there is a lot of miscommunication internally that adds on to already insane workload.

Lack of Empathy - we have a pandemic which is driving Shopee's growth, and employees are stuck with WFH arrangements where amount of workload is not visible to managers at all. When pushed back up, manager just smiles and tells us to ""manage your time better"", while the C suite cascades down to launch more markets without additional headcount in the team nor removing existing projects. Just like it was called out in WakeupSingapore IG page, 996 culture is the norm (unless you are lucky with your manager)

No work life balance at all - In the new Joiner orientation, we are presented the 5 shopee values, of which one is ""We Run"". You are assessed against this and it literally states that to meet expectations for this value, you have to ""go above and beyond"" for the company. Working 14-16hr days for weeks, and I rated B on this. Nice!"

Great learning"	"top management know there is no workife balance because they always say We Run and We Serve and We commit. 

Top management send emails and seatalk at nights and weekends, so middle leaders do the same and it trickles to rest of org where you always need to be on the go, if not you are lazy and CEO always says dont be lazy (it’s in the Values).

Rest is frowned upon, working hard til tired is expected, mental health issues are rising but Management is still growth growth growth."

- 996 work culture. Everyone works on Saturday and sometimes on Sunday.
- Promotions only happen to Chinese people
- People sleep during lunchtime just like in China
- Majority of designers from Taiwan and China
- You can only chat with the CEO if you know Chinese
- Developers sit in Shenzhen, China 🇨🇳 and you need to know Chinese to work with them"
2699	Manager from hell, avoid if you are graduate unless you are willing to suffer.	 Business Development Cross Border Analyst	27 Nov 2021	1.0	"- good pantry, above average pay
if you are foodie I guess this is attractive point."	"- Middle managers were typically under pressure and stressed and will lash it out on junior employees unreasonably and with discrimination. Nature of the job is fast paced and events based. Sales every month so means almost no rest for you if your team is lean.
- If you are a graduate be careful, because they look down on graduates. There was an incident when someone made a mistake and said individual was a fresh graduate. Entire team made comments such as, ""not a graduate again, no wonder keep making mistake. Even hurling vulgarities at the person behind the person's back. Was a shock for me to hear."
2700	Salary gap between private and local grads is big	 TEAM ASSISTANT Coz I'm From Non-local Uni	27 Nov 2021	2.0	"Multiple opportunities to do different things. got chance to achieve ""stretch goals"". very nice people in general as they are often willing to help you with work."	"Interview process
Very elitist. The recruiter was nice and upfront to tell me that cos im not from local uni, they will never give me associate rank & pay. they say private uni all start around 3k, which to me is ridiculous. who are you to judge that my uni is worth lesser than the local uni? no commons about hiring managers, feels like they dont care about me much since i was from private uni.

Salary
pay differs if you're not from NTU, NUS, SMU . if you're private uni, you start as a team assistant (analyst rank?) and get paid $1k less. i'm from private uni and they told me no matter what my grades or past references say, i can only get $3.3K. whereas my friend from NTU who got in gets a starting of $4k++.

Training
nobody gave me proper training or onboarding when i joined. they just told me this is your team, here's what you do, just learn on the job. like at least park the first month as a training-only month? 

Scope
always increasing, and expected to do more even when im just a ""team assistant"". make me do associate work but pay me way lesser than their associates. tell me doing what im paid for isnt enough and i must ""constantly stretch myself"". but your pay isnt matching up? the associate that works with me do lesser but paid 30% more than me, and you also wont promote me. was told that i can only get a certain grade coz of my uni, and even if i get promoted im only at the starting line of other local uni grads. thats super messed up. imagine doing more than people who just got in, just to prove that youre equivalent to them. what the fk?

Leadership
heard from somewhere that its the old guards that wants the salary difference to be there for private vs local uni. not sure what theyre thinking but it really sends a message when i heard it. whats the point of working hard here if they wont give people like me a chance"

- Many other employees doesn't speak English well. Moreover, since more teams are working with the Shenzhen office, most meetings ends up in Chinese even with non english speakers."
2704	Toxic culture and biased management	 Business Development Associate	27 Nov 2021	3.0	Benefits are good, good amenities and nice office	There is NO WLB, you’re suppose to be 24hr stand by. Managers will text even after office hours, even in the wee hours. Managers are biased, won’t care about you if you’re not favoured. However, some managers very fixated, dk how to think outside the box and keep asking stupid qns during meeting.
2705	Bad at treating workers but there are nice people.	 Logistics	27 Nov 2021	2.0	A bunch of them are very nice people. The salary is given on time always.	Supervisors are very biased and rude, like to smooth talk with girls and be hard on the guys. Very disrespectful and unprofessional in my opinion. However, the agent is a very nice person.
2706	Comfy office & environment	 Marketing Associate	27 Nov 2021	2.0	A lot of goodies,team mates are friendly.not the manager	Have to speak chinese,the manager & upper level mostly pr holder.u will get scolded smtimes for talking english to them even though they can speak fluent english.pity those malay & india colleagues..during meeting managers will speak in Chinese.so Those who speak Chinese will have to translate to those non Chinese colleagues.
2707	Start up woes despite not being start up stage	 Project Manager	27 Nov 2021	1.0	Good opportunities for young talent	Pace was extremely fast to the point where it’s disorganised and everyone works in silos. Branding is always trying to make shopee seem very fun, but everyone here is just bonded over shared misery and insane hours of OT that they try to justify. Upper management is extremely out of touch, rude with no human centricity at all
2708	Dynamic workplace for growth	 Anonymous Employee	26 Nov 2021	5.0	"- growth-centric role

2710	Great Workplace to Achieve	 Senior Associate	26 Nov 2021	5.0	"- Joined when still small, so was given the freedom to propose improvement projects. Received support to learn on the job to achieve the project requirements
- Great compensation when producing good value for company
- Company is deferring to shared values to unify sense of identity, rather than lengthy bureaucracy and titles
- Company can be seen to purposely try to maintain welfare of employees by rolling out more benefits and support, because honestly work is tough and they know it
- Company have healthy quarterly ""pulse-check"" survey that surveys each employee's opinion of their sustainability and impact, while also gathering feedback. This is anonymous and handled by HR so team-related feedbacks are not pressured out.
- People that work here are generally friendly and willing to help. There are some nasty ones but so far seems to be more exception than norm
- I speak against my boss openly when there are things I disagree about. I never got heat on my pay/performance level from that. So I would say at least in my team, we operate well on professional level.
- I've read that some ppl reviewed saying Shopee is racist, I just want to share that I would disagree. Indeed my colleagues are predominantly Chinese. However i don't think it's because we racially pick Chinese. Factually China is a huge nation with a huge talent pool. It's not surprising that Shopee attracted this tech talent pool. Regarding speaking chinese in meetings, my personal experience as a non-chinese speaker has been, if my colleagues are talking to me they will speak to me in English. Sometimes there are terms and ideas that they are not able to describe well in English as they are new English speaker, that they discuss better in Chinese with their peers, which to me is fine. In cases that they do switch to Chinese, and they require my input again, they will summarise their discussion and continue with me in English. I would encourage people to withhold judgement of racism, when the intent was to deepen the discussion in ways they can manage."	"- Work is hard and demanding
- We are expanding very fast. It is difficult to keep up. At times we really are stretched very thin.
- Sometimes the speed of expansion is at the cost of making patchy and unsustainable designs. Hence tech side need to do extra work to amend rushed things later.
- Very big tech stack that suffers legacy problems, but resources are still very much prioritised to churning out new features. One day it will be a super big pain, maybe soon..."

2713	Absolutely terrible WLB	 Software Engineer	25 Nov 2021	1.0	Office is nice, tries to mimic the offices of FAANG companies	Where to start? WLB is terrible, mangers are lost, company is lost. Backend is a terrible mess, literally no devops, good programming practices non-existent. Agile only in name but actually just do whatever your manager asks you to do. Mid to upper management is a brick wall but expects you to OT like mad. Learn anything? Yup, learn everything yourself, don't expect any help and expect to OT instead. Sure, they pay well but the amount of hours you put in cannot justify it. Adjusted for hours worked, its like any typical company since you're expected to put in so much extra hours.

2731	Regional Marketing department at Shopee	 Regional Marketing Associate	22 Nov 2021	4.0	Being at regional team, you have an overview picture of the markets in the region (SG, MY, TH, ID, VN PH, TW), and you know how the markets perform	"1. Being at regional marketing team, you never get to do the hand on stuff, meaning that you don't run local marketing campaigns because it's done by local teams. You are not close to your market and your consumers, I don't think this is good for your growth if you want to be a good marketer, a good marketers have to understand the costumers and the markets and be able to run local campaign on your own

- Engineering quality is going down quickly: Recently there are a lot of ""Senior""s got hired, some of them don't even know how to use git properly and they keep proposing weird technical ideas that contribute greatly to the technical debt of the company (which has been huge previously). This is the biggest downside. Another thing you have to deal with bad engineers is they work very hard but very unproductive, they keep asking you even midnight or weekend."

We often work very collaboratively towards a common goal and that really helps make things move a lot quicker. 

Micro-management doesn't really occur much, at least for my experience, we are given a lot of credibility and empowerment to work in a way we deem fit. That creates an environment that pushes us to think deeper, out of the box and take ownership"	"Given that Shopee is still relatively a young company, many processes are still ""work-in-progress"", can be quite manual at times, but it's expected of a young company that's still adjusting towards a best practice."

Analyst	11 Nov 2021	2.0	Working here will make your resume look good cause it's a big company and the people team try their best to make the employees feel cared for (with gifts and programs.) Their medical benefits are also good. Mental and physical health is cared for - both are reimbursed. Vaccination for COVID was free.	"SO MANY. First of all, hierarchy is so bad here. There are bosses and supervisors but some abuse power and have biases. Some even use their connections to make things favor towards them. They will do this in a passive-aggressive way. 

The management sucks. It will take you a year to get a raise and the raise is not even that big despite the work being so heavy. Even if you get promoted in the middle of the year, the raise comes at the end. Tenure doesn't matter in Shopee. I asked for a promotion because I was doing the same workload as people at higher ranks than me but all they could tell me was they'll consider even though I've been there longer and have done more. Instead of promoting you, they will hire new people above you then load them with the same work and volume. 

Their employees of a higher rank can be very fake too. I've encountered an employee who made it look like I was the one at fault and even set up ""proof"" that did not show the whole truth just to make themselves look good. I could not defend myself because I needed something from them in order to fully process my resignation and end all ties with Shopee. I could not risk slowing down that process and based on what happened, they were capable of doing that on purpose. 

The final payment is also not paid as early as they tell you. They overwork you endlessly but when it's time to compensate they don't do their best to show their appreciation. Shopee is shiny and inviting on the outside but really, it's just as rotten inside."

- Expects you to be on standby 24/7, even when the problems or concerns are not urgent, you just HAVE to respond ASAP. Doesn't matter whether it's the weekend, a holiday, or you're on leave
- You don't even get to use your leaves anymore because what's the point.
- Campaigns now are 3 per month, no rest at all– you're there before, during, and after the campaigns

2. No opportunity for growth
- Hiring from outside for higher positions gives even lesser hope for promotions
- Will offer internal transfers instead, but does that even promote growth, really?

3. Manual work, and manual handling of data
- Everything's so manual, limiting what you can do with data to further assist in your work
- Google sheets. Google sheets. Google sheets. Lagging Google sheets."

Looks good on resume
For the most part, colleagues are pretty helpful."	"- There's no leadership culture being passed down, everything is purely on metrics. So if the people above you in the department doesn't have any clue of what makes a good leader, the entire team is likely to suffer.
- Manager can work well with some people, but can get strangely personal with others, offering 0 help and guidance.
- When making mistake, they'd just keep telling you take 'more ownership' and redo, without giving any clarity why things are wrong. If you ask them, they will get annoyed, and ask you to ask your buddy instead.
- Again, with the wrong manager, your mental health doesn't matter. They will not notice anyway, and just keep getting upset why you are not performing."

-not much career progression, dont expect to be rewarded, blurry KPI
- HR recruiters just shoved and sugar coat you with the role during interview, job turns out different that promised. Recruiter actually don't even understand the job scope
- lack of training, members not experienced enough to train new recruits end up giving half baked answers to clients
- managers just not interested and understanding in employees concerns and suggestions. Only listen but no actions taken, waste of time talking to managers
- favouritism especially if you as a new recruit knows the senior members, you tend to get the nicer chunk of pie
- team mates are just toxic and glorifying hustle culture
- the role in department is just redundant and questionable, dont even see the point of doing the work assigned as it overlaps with other department
- nightmare for introvert like me. Job ended up like a punching bag for customers and suitable for those very extrovert kind and this constantly gives me anxiety and panic attack. HR recruiter was not honest at all and deceiving

If you wanna work here go ahead as it's good for your resume. But dont expect to expand your career here. Get the job experience and pack your bags after a year or two. Also question your HR recruiter and also the interviewers and get a clear view of the role. Most of the times they just wanna get an extra pair of hands to do the work"

2922	Think twice	 Marketing	22 Sep 2021	2.0	"- Established branding and strong presence in SEA. Aggressive ventures and expansion in other markets.

- Steep learning curve, suitable for those looking to equip themselves with skills and e-commerce knowledge in a short period of time."	"Overall, toxic culture as a result of poor managers and lack of transparency in communication.

- Horrible managers who are mostly inexperienced and political. They mostly suck up to senior management and what is appalling is most managers are so out of touch with the working teams that they have little to no knowledge on the product and actual implementation. And what does this mean is that if you join, expect to NOT get any knowledge or guidance from the managers as they cannot really educate you. They can only share with you “the concept on a high-level” and disguise it as “go figure the rest out yourself” most of the time.

- Managers generally lack of empathy. Throwing people under the bus and blaming culture is a common behaviour observed among managers and leads. There are also some leads in Marketing who practice double standards - if you do not carry a ‘lead’ or ‘manager’ title, they do not really respond to you or bother responding to your questions, may it be in person, SeaTalk (Shopee’s version of WhatsApp) or email. 

- High volume of workload as a result of never-ending campaigns and projects. There’s no such thing as low/high priority here (especially in Marketing). Everything is of high priority and requires attention - doesn’t matter if project is less impactful or has less potential simply because these managers and leads want to appease the bosses above.  Also, expect to work till midnight, weekends, and even on public holidays (Raya, CNY, Christmas).

- Funny how Shopee prides themselves as a tech company but truth is, a LOT of manual work happens behind the scenes. Simple things such as uploading banners, voucher creation, whitelisting etc requires a large amount of effort but feature updates and improvements nowhere to be heard or often deprioritized. 

- Whatever you read on Glassdoor about Shopee’s attrition rate is true. Turnover rate is sky high and yet nobody is addressing the elephant in the room."

2930	Be ready to be squeezed dry	 Product Manager	20 Sep 2021	3.0	"You will learn a lot in a very short time
Structure is very flat, so you don't have red tape that you see in banks and other big MNCs. Generally everyone listens to pragmatism
If you make it into the inner circle, you probably will be compensated with stock. If you joined early in SEA's rise, $$$ for you. If you joined in 2021.... then maybe not that amazing."	"Everyone is young and hungry, so the culture is to OT to prove yourself and your value to the company
Many teams hire a large proportion of chinese expatriates who are young as well. Be prepared to have cultural clashes, as well as language barriers with them, even if your team speaks predominantly english
Don't expect pay progression to happen. You are easily replaced by the next batch of wide-eyed hopeful and hungry fresh grad.
The chinese culture also brings an unofficial 996 to the company even if you're not based in SZ. if some teams are 996 in China, don't expect your work chat to be silent on weekends

Overall you probably going to get burnt out. If you joined early and have fat stocks... then maybe worth the grind? But probably better idea to move to another MNC with better progression after you learned enough"

2961	Do not join if you don't want inexperienced, politically motivated leaders	 Product Manager	12 Sep 2021	1.0	Good for fresh grads to get a job since Shopee is hiring a lot. But not good if you want to be a real product manager. Or if you are a senior product manager, please avoid at all costs.	"1. After a good run till early 2021, upper management seems to think it's a good time to start an internal overhaul. Many teams are restructured for the ""good of the company"". but are actually politically motivated. Many people have left the company over the last couple of months and teams are overtaken by new joiners. In fact, many teams have moved to China because maybe now management is so complacent that they believe product & engineering teams are non-essential.

2. Product management department leaders are inexperienced and don't understand what being a product manager really means. They don't have experience at other big tech companies as product managers and just got to where they are by being the most senior person. Majority of them don't measure metrics, don't properly roadmap, and just end up rushing whatever business requests. They aren't real product managers, they are more like implementation project managers receiving work from business and also somehow doing the work of engineers & designers e.g. ux design or technical design. Due to their inexperience and premature promotion into managers, they are also terrible at leading and don't practice servant leadership. Most of them are just focused on self-promotion, with the exception of some experienced managers.

If it was only their incompetence & lack of leadership, maybe it's not that bad. But many of them, specifically those leaders heading the Order team and now almost taken control of the entire Marketplace, engage in empire building. It's an open secret in the department that they somehow got the trust of the upper management and took control of many product teams in an almost villainous manner, unfairly weeding out previous team leads who have spent years building their own teams, and transferring their own team members to take over them. Even other product heads were weeded out or had their scopes reduced in favour of those power-hungry Order team leads. The way in which they operated led to departures of many senior product managers, leading to a very depressing morale in the product department. Many product managers around me are in interview process. 

Due to the highly political nature of the current product department, I strongly advise talented senior product managers to avoid this place, as you will not get true recognition here. If you are in the wrong team, you can expect to have a lot of difficulty getting recognition or getting thrown around with the restructuring. Even if you are in the ""right"" team which is in power now, you can forget about your personal growth as your manager will only be concerned with getting more power for themselves and using you as a pawn.

3. Compensation here is terrible. HR will definitely low ball you. I'm already in the process of accepting an offer double the salary here."

- Good brand name.
- Soaring stock price, if you have stock will make you happier to stay.

3062	Only if I knew this beforehand	 Analyst	10 Aug 2021	2.0	"1. People are generally nice, minimal/no office politics

2. Everyone is willing to share and offer help when necessary"	"1. Brief hierarchy of the company: Team Assistant (TA); Associate; Senior Associate; So on and so forth. If you just graduate from NUS/NTU/SMU, the entry level position offered to you will be Associate. If you're from any other local/private unis in SG, the entry level position the company deem suited for you is TA. So you may graduate the same year as your friend but they may be your superior because of your school:) These are applicable for fresh grads and majority of the teams only. 

TLDR, as a TA, you're basically everybody's assistant. You take instructions from anyone above your ""rank""

2. Your day end at 7PM, so naturally you will miss your usual dinner time with your family and friends taking into consideration the travel time. (Timing can never match with your friends unless they starve and wait for you)

3. OT is norm and not paid (you feel elated when you're able to get out of office on time and still see bright sky lol. dont try to plan anything outside of work cause tasks are unpredictable and you may be given a task at 630PM and they expect you to complete asap)

4. Managers check in with you time to time and after sharing your concerns, work are still given to you (mgrs check for the sake of checking, they also need to report mah)

5. People are still working on leave/after office hours. Receiving messages and emails at 12AM? norm

6. If you speak chinese
a) awesome cause you can 'blend"" in easier and mgrs are generally glad to hear that you speak their mother tongue language
b)boo cause you need to help your non-chinese speaking teammates (not their fault btw) with their work AKA translation. ppl from other teams will prefer to seek help from you than your teammate since they can communicate better with you in their language

7. No clear career progression, job scope not defined (always doing work with no background given)

8. Turnover rate high. around half of my teammates has left after staying for less than 6 months or before their 3 months probation. The burnout is real:)

9. Work is extremely manual. Time spent on Crtl C + Crtl V takes up your whole day, thats why the company needs TA

10. The only time you get to interact with your teammates is lunch time/ team bonding session (usually held after work but will still attend cause FOMO)"

Difficult to get work-life balance."
3112	Growth opportunity but..	 Senior Product Manager	26 Jul 2021	3.0	Endless (company and personal) growth and projects for you to work on, everyday every period is a peak period. The company values growth above everything so there is a lot of room for new initiatives. The manpower is stretched so juniors and seniors have chance to drive major / key projects.	"1. Leadership team is young hence does not possess the relevant experience and leadership skills like communication, nurturing, stewardship nor charisma to drive the team. Leaders mainly focus on executing when they should primarily be focused on grooming people. So from top to down, there is no emphasis/ importance on people culture, just get work done which results in high turnover. Personally changed more than 3 managers during my stint. 

2. Growth in career is a major trade-off with your personal life. Non-existent work-life balance and this is a basic expectation as you take on the role/ projects. No work life balance is the norm and you would feel 'judged' if you have work life balance. Someone once said ""wow how lucky you're leaving on time"" to me. To me, this is toxic but it is really a personal preference on how much one is willing to trade off. 

3. Flawed reward and recognition system; many promotions are typically given to people who have been in the company since the 'beginning' and may not be as experienced. Compensation is slightly below average compared to industry (similar size firms) in this role but not necessarily true for other roles.

4. Importance of speaking Chinese; It is not a preferred skill but rather a survival skill in this role."

- Child and family leave 
- Birthday leave 
- the company is working on improving work-life balance, I would say for most days I can end work on time except on huge campaign days
- Due to the nature of the job, merchants and internal colleagues may still contact me out of working hours, but it is still acceptable (this expectation was outlined during interview) 
- I appreciate my manager's approval for me to WFH even before MCO/FMCO as the Covid cases were spiking (it depends on manager's approval)"	"- Lack of direction and KPI, you have to be very self driven 
- Poor onboarding experience in terms of handover from manager
- My previous manager was very toxic, gave me unnecessary pressure and repeatedly asked me for status on a task, made me work til midnight including the weekends for it, then after I'm done the manager gaslighted me by saying it actually isn't my task to work on and that I should be prioritising other things. 
- Some colleagues have no sense of boundary and may even message you at midnight for non-urgent work matters"

2. Decent salary and benefits

3. Brand-name reputation in the region, and is only getting bigger"	"1. 0 separation between work and personal life:
- The nature of campaigns being run is that they go live at 12AM. This technically means you'll have a lot of days spent working till 12AM and beyond just to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you're someone who wants to plan a life outside of work, FORGET ABOUT IT.
- Like many other reviews have mentioned, the working hours are dismal, OT is the norm/expected and goes largely uncompensated. You might think that it only gets intense during big sale periods, but that is not true. You work at a back-breaking pace all year long, and management likes to assuage you that it gets better after 9.9/10.10/11.11, but that is simply not the case. The pace at which campaigns switch up and change every month leaves no respite, and most colleagues who have been here for more than 1.5 years are absolutely burnt out.
- Frequent meetings scheduled at 7PM (end of work)/our TOWNHALLS are held after working hours. Need I say more?
- On townhalls: during one of the presentations on Shopee's ""core values"", one of the slides presented was the core value ""I Commit"", where the slide states that exemplifying this value means employees must ""Make personal sacrifices for the organization"". On the other hand, an example given for someone who doesn't fulfill the core value is someone who ""Puts personal interests ahead of the organization"". I have no better example than this anecdote to illustrate the toxicity of working at Shopee.

2. The Backend is a mess.
- Product teams are expected to rush out new features to aggressively pursue growth, at the expense of quality-of-life features for employees. Therefore, what you get is a backend system that is extremely tedious and cumbersome, to the extent that some operations require you to be up at 12AM to simply push a button or edit a field, day in, day out. Completely unsustainable. When you request an update/improvement, they can only tell you that ""quality-of-life updates are in the pipeline, but are lowest priority"". 
- This is another example of how the C-level couldn't care less about their employees. Product teams push out features that are a complete mess on the backend and expect employees to work inefficiently to fill up the gaps. All in the name of rushing out some half-baked feature because ""our competitor is doing it too"".

3. Alarming lack of diversity
- Yes, the reviews are spot-on. The diversity in this company is abysmal. Working in Singapore, you will encounter entire tech teams that can only converse in Mandarin. If you don't speak their language, sitting in a meeting with them is a total nightmare. This is an issue that has been raised many times, and management has failed to address it."

Poor work-life balance (people are sending emails on days off and updating JIRA tickets at 4am!), rule by diktat
Tech debt needs to be repaid, plenty of old code that is holding back new projects (just mention ""coreserver"" to any dev - glad that's going away)"
3155	Good	 Social Media Specialist	13 Jul 2021	3.0	Good, nice, comfortable, kind, well	bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
3156	Overall management needs to improve	 Marketing Analyst	13 Jul 2021	2.0	"-Flat organizational structure.
-Young demographic, average age would be around 25.
-Benefits are okay, WFH setup with support (i.e. wifi reimbursement) during the pandemic.
-Trainings are provided.
-Growing industry."	"-Very very high attrition rate. People only last 1 year if they don't leave earlier than that. Management/HR doesn't seem to be proactively doing anything about this since they'll just hire replacements.
-Upper management roles usually filled by expats instead of local talents. This causes a gap in understanding the local market and also affects overall leadership at times. They have little to no knowledge on on-the-ground execution and expect their team members to do things on the snap of a finger. 
-There's a lack in company-wide standardized processes especially with the virtual set up. One team's processes may differ from another. Overall internal communication is a mess, everything is cascaded and announced via Seatalk which is difficult to document and look back on. Too much chat groups with so many stakeholders which could have been easily solved by creating email lists. HR needs to look into this and improve because sometimes the leads themselves are disorganized. 
-No one enters the e-commerce industry not knowing that it's notorious for crazy hours. But management needs to stop glorifying overwork. Please prioritize your employees well-being so they don't eventually burn out. And no, this doesn't mean provide them with more mental health webinars. Revisit the workload distribution. Maybe evaluate if team leads are actually equipped with leadership skills. If a team member is doing 60 hours of OT per month, that doesn't mean he/she is an exemplary employee. That means you need speed up and hire 3 more people ASAP.  
-Pay gaps. HR will low-ball you if you were paid lower at your previous job even if you have the same experiece as another employee.
-HR will promise you performance bonuses but it is very very low despite good performance. 
-Management does a lot of questionable things in terms of strategy. The tendency to pivot a lot is given because of stiff competition, but Shopee needs to re-evaluate its intiatives in marketing and not just be reactive to LZD all the time."

3169	Growing but not the best place for early career	 Campaign Analyst	10 Jul 2021	1.0	it's growing and shopee has a large SEA presence.	"I think the most shocking thing in my time here is the professionalism of management and workers, in addition to the notorious hours and repetitive work that is already known with campaigns.

 Yes all managers are busy, but what kind of manager allows himself or herself to lie in order to support his or her beliefs/narrative of the story? This has happened to me twice with my manager. Once, I rode it off as a misunderstanding when I was being interrogated by weird questions about a scenario I barely knew about but encountering condescending tones from my manager as if I were to blame. 

The second time, I noticed the same thing again as he or she begins to spew out assumptions and weird questions based on something he or she heard? An example would be, ""this guy said this and this about this scenario, you were potentially doing XXX"". I go ask the colleague and weirdly the response would be I haven't talked ot the manager. Again, so many red flags about the integrity of managers/workers if this happens. 

Also, saw one person wrote that because hierarchy is so flat everyone is trying to be everyone's boss one way or another. This is so true.

Career growth opportunities are low. Not a lot of opportunities to learn a varied skillset, and it's weird that people here actually scold you for trying to learn more. So, I wouldn't recommend for people early in their careers."

- Friendly workmates and casual environment
- WFH, laptop, phone, quarterly team building
- So-so benefits.
- 3 weeks intensive training and another set of trainings under your category and tier level.
- Incentive when you acquire a seller to join selected campaigns (if you belong to a certain team)
- Campaigns can be done in a month"	"- Insane amount of google sheets trackers.
- Insane amount of meetings
- First time to witness attendance through gsheets instead of a system.
- Needs better systems / processes because they heavily rely on google sheets and google forms/stackforms. Then again, they don't seem to invest in it.
- Good branding but deceptive on the inside. 
- Upper management only cares about the results or numbers. Doesn't care about the people. Mostly Chinese with little firsthand knowledge about the country and culture. Rarely seen Filipinos in upper management roles. 
- Initiatives feels like I'm scamming accounts.
- You work to make the boss look good for his/her boss.
- Stressful workload. Strict when it comes to overtime unless it's an official task. But you need to catch up with the workload so you end up doing an OT without pay.
- If you're placed in ST, you get PIC roles and growth. Packages to pitch are much expensive. MT, little growth. Equally stressful because of adhoc work and seller concerns.
- Basically, the role is growing your shops, pitch to sellers, plot for deals and campaigns, assist seller concerns. Feels like a sales agent role.
- One campaign hasn't even started, you will be introduced to the next month's campaign. 
- Disorganized, sabog and communication heavily relies on chat app which makes tracking hard. People aren't as responsive in email as to chat app. So you tend to miss announcements and reports. Also, the amount of chat groups is insane.
- Short term plans. Long term is not visible because it is constantly changing.
- Chaotic processes leads to unnecessary stress for client facing roles.
- Pushes A LOT of marketing initiatives.
- High turnover like <5 people leave in a month per category. Management doesn't really address this since they'll just replace people. People usually last 1 year then leave.
- A lot in the team, roughly around 80-100. So it's kinda hard to climb up.
- As an external hire, I'm disappointed because it isn't as efficient as it brands itself, but if you like fast, wear multiple hats, multitask, maybe it's for you.
- Management says they understand but don't do much about it. It's all words."

3203	Probably the worst company culture you could think of	 Assistant Manager	29 Jun 2021	1.0	"Soaring stock price. Especially if you joined early.Trust me, most of the seniors there are only staying to vest their stock which grew 10x to 20x over the past couple of years. They stay for the stock/pay - which is a great, and 
maybe only, “pro”

Hands-on experience since it’s still a start up company and has a much leaner process vs bigger companies.Your work probably has bigger revenue/growth impact vs biggercompanies. This pro could also be a con depending on your preference e.g. If you don’t want to do trivial work."	"Horrifying culture that trickles down from the leadership. Horrifying. Period. Especially if you’re not used to hard-core a Chinese company culture. Just imagine the worst and that’s what it is. Employees are told to prioritize what’s best for Shopee over what’s best for yourself, unless it’s a “life or death” matter. Actual quote from the Csuite. Sound insane? True story.

Not much to learn. Is there a strategy other than (1) Exponentially expanding to other markets burning cash, or (2) Endlessly hiring juniors to do the operational, manual, boring work vs actual tech innovation? Maybe. But if there is, it’s clearly not communicated down to the juniors.

Sky high turnover rate. Most sensible people come in, get a shock, leave (many people leave even before 3 months probation out of pure shock), or constantly try to leave. Have you come across Shopee employees who are not actively trying to leave? Probably waiting for their stock to vest."

3347	Good place	 Software Engineer	17 May 2021	4.0	Most co-workers and managers are easy to work with.	Long working hours from 9:30AM to 7:00PM, with lunch break 12:30 to 2:00PM.

3353	ZERO work life balance & psychotic top management who treat employees like slaves	 Marketing Associate	14 May 2021	1.0	Abundance of snacks in the office. But you’re better off buying your own snacks than working in this hell of a company.	"- ZERO work life balance as you’re expected to work way past working hours (most weekdays till 1am), public holidays & weekends. You’re expected to be contactable 24/7 (literally).

-  Top-down management approach, meaning whatever management or your boss tells you to do, you have to do it even if you have to stay up for 48 hours to finish something assigned to you at the last minute without a wink of sleep.

- Your voice is not heard AT ALL. You can try speaking to your boss or HR about issues that you’re facing at work but it’ll only get brushed off.

- Terrible & incompetent teammates. As the company is very flat, many (if not all) your more senior teammates will try to be your mini boss.

- Horrible working culture as there is so much hostility among different teams.

- No training or proper guidance whatsoever and you’re only assigned a buddy at the start to “teach” you. If you’re as unlucky as most, your buddy won’t teach you anything. If you’re a fresh grad, you should run and look elsewhere.

- Crazy bosses who work round the clock, have no life and expect you to be as miserable as them.

- Work for 20 hours & sleep for 4 hours during peak days of big campaigns (i.e. 11.11, 12.12). The best part is that your bosses would act like it’s no big deal that you’re sacrificing your sleep & weekend every month.

- Crazy attrition rate, meaning at least 1 of your team member would leave the company every month. Even though the company is hiring aggressively, it’s a waste of time having to train & retrain your colleagues since most people will leave rather quickly.

- Company’s only long-term mission is to beat Lazada out of the market. 

- Manual workflows that require intensive human labour. As one of my ex-colleagues once put it, Shopee is a human sweatshop.

My advice - unless you’ve gone crazy, no amount of salary would make it worth working here."

"- Toxic leaders: not sure if you heard of PUA (pickup artists), to put it in a simple way, the leader criticise you for your own good. In this context, it is a euphemism for mind control, brainwashing and suppression that you get from the leaders. 
- Messy structure: various team are doing the same scope.  You feel you are competing with internal teams - don't think it's healthy in the long run. 
- No transparency: lots of re-org in the company, and sorry guys you are the last one to be notified, and the change happens TOMORROW ;) you need to pickup the pieces of information by yourself to understand what is going on. 
- Let's talk about the culture: For the above, if you cannot accept, sorry you are not a 'culture fit': 'you cannot deal with ambiguity, and you can not adapt'. They just beautify their wholes with these culture stuff."

- Projects get done quickly
- Really good at presenting a friendly, 'fun' company image through PR stunts (actually, this is a con)"	"- Job scope not defined, often get roped into doing things completely out of your job scope 
- Unreasonable working hours and timing: projects come in with insanely short deadlines to meet, overtime is always expected and not compensated
- Cold culture: the culture is suffocating and transactional. People might have bright personalities but it is squandered due to the suffocating nature of how fast things move here. People don't say Hi. Very common to now know the name of the person sitting a row across from you  for over a year if you're not on the same team.
- Directionless: because projects move so fast, they often come in with very little strategic purpose. This leads to lots of projects being scrapped or double work occurring across teams (after people have put in insane amounts of working hours)
- Deaf and micromanaging upper management: upper management is extremely nitpicky (executive level officers asking to change the font size and colors in presentations) and tone deaf to the needs of employees. You can easily expect emails coming in past 10pm on a regular basis
- Disorganised communication: Majority of work related issues are solved through a work-chat application. This means that important updates and points are lost in the countless groups and personal chats"

- Work with some smart and hard-working peers
- Pantry has lots of drinks and snacks"	"- Get ready that you won't receive last month salary within legitimate time - not later than one month from the termination of employment- if tender resignation 
- HRs are very irresponsive and unhelpful especially after you leave company

Here is my story that I haven't got paid till now:
I've left Shopee in 24 Feb of 2021, yet haven't received my remaining salary so far. It's a norm that company will withhold last month salary until tax clearance comes out. But the date to receive remaining salary shouldn't be later than 30 days after the termination of employment, i.e. company should pay you no later than one month after last employment day even though the tax assessment hasn't been submitted or done. (what MOM told me) 

After I left company, I've sent some emails to seek advise from HRs regarding when to expect my remaining salary and when to file my tax assessment. I got ZERO reply. I didn't realize Shopee violates the law until I called out and checked details with IRAS and MOM many times, so I reported an employment act violation to MOM and forwarded the mail to HRs to ask for the status of my remaining salary. And finally they answered me and told me to wait till tax clearance came out sometime maybe in mid May (they filed my tax assessment on 8 Apr which was more than 1.5 mths after I left Shopee) That's really unacceptable! Now, I've been in touch with MOM again and hopefully they'll push Shopee to pay me ASAP. 

Sharing my irritating experience about dealing with Shopee regarding my last mth salary is to give you a heads up when you resign. Good luck!"

3512	AVOID AT ALL COSTS	 Analyst	6 Apr 2021	1.0	Nice office which lures you into thinking the company cares about you	"THE WORST place I have ever worked at. Nothing gets worse then this. The marketing department is filled with racist, bullying colleagues who will do ANYTHING to step on you to get what they want. 

→ There is NO such thing as work life balance here. I would work from 8 AM until 1 AM at night every single day for MONTHS. Management don't care if you burnout because they have someone else ready to replace you once you're done. Campaign period was the worst where we were staffed on weekends, and would work past midnight most days. 

→ No job security: I would get threatened by my manager that they would fire me if I didn't do more overtime or deliver. This is a very common technique they used with other employees to scare them into working harder. 

→ People are INCREDIBLY rude. I have never met such passive aggressive managers and colleagues. People would intentionally highlight your mistakes to the manager to step on you, and get promoted ahead of you. 

→ Turnover is incredibly high (half our team turned over within half a year, with several others thinking to quit). 

→ People were racist, and I would not advise working here unless if you're Singaporean Chinese/from mainland China. People were racist to me several times, and I felt limited in the opportunities that I had because of my race. 

→ No sense of accomplishment: Everything is about MORE at Shopee. Once 9.9 campaign is over, it's time to focus on 10.10, 11.11 and 12.12. I never was once thanked or appreciated for any of my efforts, and was always forced to look ahead. 

STAY away from this place if you care about your wellbeing and overall job prospects. I've seen many people who absolutely hate their job at Shopee but cannot leave because they are scared of leaving, and so they instead just try to climb upwards. The worst half year of my life, and now I'm making a higher salary and working half as many hours at a better company that cares about my wellbeing."

3598	Above Average Compensation. Great for Fresh Graduates (The Philippines)	 Junior Relationship Manager	14 Mar 2021	4.0	"Good salary for the entry-level positions. Shopee is a good company for fresh graduates who want to start their career strong, in a relevant company in the Philippines.

Shopee has been in a WFH setting since the lockdown started, it's optional to work at the office, located in Taguig.

Aside from the salary, there are a generous amount of leaves (although, you must pass the probationary period, which is 6 months). HMO benefit is also great, as they cover outpatient services for mental health and the ambulance fee, which are rare inclusions on HMOs.

Plenty of opportunities for self-development in the company, programs are available for employees to participate in. They even reimburse other courses that you take, as long as it's relevant to your position.

Team culture is great, my team is very helpful whenever I need assistance. I feel like I'm somewhat in a college organization again, but it makes the environment less boring."	"Difficult to perform tasks because of constant changes mandated from other departments. The Relationship Manager role can be difficult because of this, our position does not decide on the changes, we only implement the changes.

Cross-communication between other departments needs to improve, Again, this affects our performance and the accounts that we handle.

If you cannot, or do not like to multitask, the Relationship Manager role is not for you. There are always sudden deadlines to meet, aside from balancing the current workload."

Working till midnight is common. Being sent tasks while on off-days and medical leave is common. Being given urgent tasks after work hours to be completed immediately is common. Teams are not able to give input on management decisions because the culture is top down. On the whole, expect 14 hour work days. Teams work in silos, which results in confusion and time spent on chasing for deliverables. A lot of time spent on internal reporting to show the management that the team is producing work. No clarity on career progression. Management values employees who spend the most time at work.

3650	Soso	 Product Manager	28 Feb 2021	3.0	pass this question for now	messy management and the decision-making process
3651	Really really really bad culture	 Software Engineer	28 Feb 2021	1.0	"Nice office
- Gym
- Amenties
- Long lunch hour"	"- Lot of freshers and high attrition rate has caused the codebase to be unmaintainable. Employees are discouraged to fix it, and forced to put patches instead of scaling. No best practices, more like hacky college project.

- Company pays you for 10am-7pm and expects you to work till 10pm. It is so shameful and sad that company arranges town-hall meeting after 7pm. Meetings after 7pm is quite normal.

- Company benefits are horrible. $1000 limit for insurance. Does the company know how much specialist cost in Singapore?

If you really believe in engineering, then stay away from this company. I made mistake to join the company because of their huge stock values, and but guess what it is not worth at all. I have lost all peace of mind."

3671	Good culture, fast paced	 Associate	23 Feb 2021	4.0	Good culture, good teammates. Environment is ok.	Fast paced, can get very stressful at times
3672	Unsupportive HR and staffs are treated unfairly	 Team Lead	23 Feb 2021	2.0	Great and friendly colleagues who are pretty supportive	"1. HR squeezes out the staff as they are mainly focusing on making money for the company, and refused to hear out the options, feedback provided from the staff. 

2. Can you imagine that promotion has NO promotion increment, but just a title? Yes, that happened in SHOPEE MALAYSIA. So think twice before you join. 

3. As a freshie, if you start your pay at a lower range, don't ever think that Shopee would give you a higher pay when you're here for long. 

4. Pay between an Associate who served the company for a year long is ~RM500 differences between a Senior Associate. Yes, this happened. 

5. A junior pay (less than 6months) is higher than a senior (2 years within the company). Yes, that happened too. 

6. Intern is having a higher pay than a full time. Oh yes, if you wish to have a higher pay as an intern, join Shopee. 

7. Regardless of how hard you work, how well you do your job; at the end of the day, the middle management would only rate you based on your 'relationship' with them. 

- A staff who worked tirelessly with the manager until 3-4am yet the increment and bonus in 2020 was less than 9%. (Oh well, the staff tendered without securing a job as the staff was tired of how Shopee manage their staff/ policies etc). 
- A managerial staff who is LESS COMPETENT, great at phrasing beautiful words, definitely a great talker, yet can't do the job well (as in managing a team, handling a project) is STILL act as a manager. Currently, 90% of the team members left the team, except the favourite member who scored an A in last year's assessment.

8. Thinking of career progression in Shopee, please look for other places. They only intend to push someone from the outside world to take care of their portfolio."
3673	Software engineer	 Anonymous Employee	22 Feb 2021	3.0	not too bad for ng, but won't last long	"too much meanless overtime work, too much ""Chris want this"""
3674	A lot to be improved	 Product Manager	22 Feb 2021	1.0	"I can barely think of any... some developers are really nice. Other than that, PM and business people are very self-centric and not very pleasant to work with.
Thumbs up to myself for being able escape from here and find a pleasant company."	"1. HR can surely be more helpful and less ignorant. Once you left the company, they no longer answer your question regarding pending matters. No one is ever going to respond to you.
And interestingly, look at the short and repetitive good reviews showing up here. Like some reviews mentioned, HR FAKED MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS. THAT'S CHEATING!
2. HR low ball you all the time. Try very hard to negotiate the salary when they offer. Ask for a 20% higher number than your expectation because the HR will low ball you by cutting a 20% even though you give a very reasonable number.
3. Incompetent team managers who are extremely young think they are the best. They got to that place only because they kissed up to higher ups. They literally know nothing about team management and morale management. My team manager bluntly told my teammate I don't care about the moral... in my entire career, I have never met such an ignorant team manager.
4. Depends on your team, the projects you work on or even the entire product line can be cancelled or treated like a joke if your manager only cares about politics and showing face in front of senior management. Some team leaders treated their own projects like a joke and only cares about how to window-dress the project results. 
5. A lot of Chinese people and team managers who can't speak proper English. Good luck to you if your Chinese is not good enough to get the unspoken message. Be prepared for high-contextual Chinese your managers will use and the weird English they speak in.
6. People do not understand the meaning of OFF-WORK and PRIVACY. Ping you every now and then after work."

- Lack of direction, and there were instances where senior management changes their mind multiple times within the same day. 
- No innovation - improvements and new features often done because a chinese competitor is doing it. 
- Inexperienced managers and team leads who have no experience leading a team and only micromanage, or are simply messengers from what upper management wants with no opinions of their own. Managers also often lack EQ and can be condescending to subordinates
- No one believes in proper briefing. Information often comes in bits and pieces with little to no background context. 
- Very chinese-centric. Some decks and product documents are written in Chinese, expecting everyone in team to understand despite Chinese fluency not being a part of the job description. 
- No empathy for employees and amidst the current pandemic, pushed employees back to work from office as much as they can - huge contrast from other forward-thinking tech companies
- Expectation to work long hours (see points of being disorganized and lack of briefing)"

People are young and no matter at which level, employees are free to express their suggestions and feedback. It also feels like your inputs are valued and important. It is also a great place to grow as you are given big responsibilities.	No work-life balance. Although work is just 8 hrs a day. It's very hard to fit the work load into that. Poor project communication lead to confusion. A lot of projects being introduced and happening at the same can result to burn out.

24h on call if u are maintaining a live service. 
top-down management , some manager seem like to squeeze every letfover energy of team members to promote themself or KPI things, and make work here gets complicated. And emotional and biased. Play favoritism games.

-All the other comments you see about middle management being bad is not wrong at all. It is totally true.
-HR will seriously low ball you during the offer stage. It already says a lot about the company
-I see people leaving the company very often. Every month, there is someone I know in the company who is leaving soon or has already left
-Highly inefficient organisation. Information relay is poor, processes are poor, structure is poor. Many redundant processes and workflows

- other colleagues"	"- well known that reg customer service is a depressing place, with continuously low scores in the employee survey, one of the lowest in shopee

- bosses do not care about team bonding or team culture. To them you are just a number, a cost centre. They are quick to blame, slow to appreciate. 

- Bosses work ridiculously long hours (10pm daily) and expect employees to do the same or get judged.

- high turnover rate (about 1 quit per month), which says a lot about the team as a whole

- had a very incompetent boss. Many unnecessary requests. Can create a version 1 of something, only to have boss give feedback to have it made 10x more complex, and in the end not feasible and back to version 1. No clear direction, just work for the sake of it.

- lots of micromanagement. U feel like ur working for the boss, not with the boss to tackle the projects. when things go wrong you are to blame.

Please save your time and go elsewhere, anywhere"

There is quite a lot of pressure in everyday work especially from the PMs (who are presumably pressured even more from their bosses). Also it feels a bit Chinese-oriented, for example sometimes in meetings they will speak Chinese and non-Chinese speakers as myself can get a bit confused.

3808	Mostly unfulfilling work	 Relationship Manager	20 Jan 2021	2.0	Good people to work with, also relatively chill unless there's a big campaign coming up, but if you want to feel useful, you might want to go elsewhere.	Salaries are low, increases are low, the bosses are expats who don't really care about the market that they're coming into, there's no clarity on the grading system and there seems to be a lot of variation in increases despite the fact that people are graded with the same letter grade. No upward mobility. Management mostly out of touch.
3809	You've been warned	 Associate	20 Jan 2021	1.0	Can't really think of much unless you think young environment and getting free gifts are a plus.	"Recruiters don't tell you the truth and reality of the long hours. You are worked to the bone and be prepared to be working until 3am.
They only care about the buyers. Read between the lines. 
Things are very manual and there are more layers than you'd expect. 
Their employer branding has been done exceptionally well. Again, read between the lines.
Only reason why people are still joining is because they are actively hiring. Be prepared to lose all your leisure, family time to make way for this new family of yours."

If you are a family man/women don't expect to go home see your kids make dinner all. If you are a student your manager will tell you see how if you can go attend your class or not even if they know you're a working student. What kind of response is that? 
Also offered me job say job is only mine if I can start in 2 weeks even if they know my notice is 1 month in resume. 
Working hours states 930am to 7pm. But some people come 1030 already still go home 7pm manager say nothing. People take 2.5hrs lunch also manager say nothing. But when ask if can leave to go to school answer is see how. 
Can't stay here if you want worklife balance. Very draining sure burn out. Also if you are non Chinese you're going to be discriminated. If you are a young person with no family went to top uni and willing to bring back laptop everyday this is place for you. If you have other commitment outside go say bye bye to them already."

Good to be able to interact with teams in different countries and learn from them as well.	Very fast-paced and can be a 'con' for someone who isn't used to that kind of setup.
3821	Probably the realest review you'll see here	 Business Development	18 Jan 2021	1.0	"- Strong corporate branding; company has been pretty effective in showcasing how ""great"" they are. Tech hackathons, great office amenities...oh spare me please.

- Fast-paced. Some may like the hustle. But the word fast-paced is often misused. The real reason why the work life of Shopee as fast-paced is because there are so many inefficiencies plaguing the company. Lack of systems, high staff count (they say its expansion, but hey, it's because you lack any foundations and hiring more is just a stop-gap measure)"	"- As I've mentioned, lack of proper internal tools and systems to streamline workload. A lot of manual work.

- Top down approach. A lot of yes men and women in this company, particularly middle management. Employees who are bottom of the command chain suffers.

- Inexperienced managers and leadership. Chaotic. Political. Especially with the mass hiring practices. 
good employee may not make a good manager. I've seen many who are promoted to people managers in a short span of time, but their leadership skills can be lacking."

OT culture is expected.

Employees do not embody their own company values. This is highly damning as they often use this as a yardstick to judge others.

Due to bloated department size, politics is to be expected."
3916	Don’t act like a big tech company when your culture isn’t up to standard	 Engineer	5 Dec 2020	1.0	"Good benefits, free food and drinks (bubble tea). 
Able to experience managing a project from start to end.
Relatively good exposure to various subject matters."	"Extremely biased against employees who don’t speak Chinese as their main language. You’ll be ostracised and don’t feel like you’re part of the team. This is Singapore, not China.

The seniors and managers love bootlickers. You don’t need to be competent in your job; as long as you make the people “up there” happy, you’re guaranteed a smooth sailing career. True hard workers, however, are subject to criticism all the time. 

Expects everyone to devote their time to the company 24/7, but do not acknowledge one’s efforts. Extremely results-focused. You can devote 24 hours in a day but as long as they deem your work as unsatisfactory, don’t even dream of getting recognised for the hard work you put in. Isn’t the point of an entry level job for you to learn and grow? If you pay an entry level salary and expect the employee to magically make zero mistakes, you’re very wrong.

They pride themselves for being a growing “top” e-commerce company in the region, acting like a Google wannabe but their working culture is very much like any SME out there. 

Bad planning in management as well. Managers are only managers because of the years they put in for the company; not whether they can truly lead a team.  As a result, you see many seniors who can do their work properly, but are clearly not of managerial material."

Learn quite a bit about technical project management, coming as someone with no relevant background	"Terrible working culture. More than half of my department were from the mainland, and with it comes a certain different work culture as well. Very inflexible to change, reluctance to adopt new ideas and suggestions in improving work processes. Chinese management comes with the expectation of OT, where leaving ON TIME or even 30 minutes past working hours will get you questioned on why you're leaving. Expect to work until 11pm on multiple days a week just to meet departmental expectations.
HR statistics on OT were also skewed, I witnessed first hand, how some colleagues had to deliberately submit heavily edited reports on working hours, cutting the actual OT hours worked in the past month by more than 80% just to provide a visually appealing result back to the HR department.
Many colleagues share negative sentiments on the work life balance upon joining, and are simply looking to get the experience and move on to the next, better workplace as soon as possible"

2) An opportunity to be a leader due to its current aggressive hiring policy (There is a lack of System QA talents in Singapore due to the job scope is not actively learnt in the university, unlike example, Java / Python developer or DBA)
3) Lots of benefits, including Union membership, Gym within company compound and 18 days of annual leave (Longer than standard 14 days elsewhere)
4) Annual Bonus can be up to 3 months, subjected to meeting / exceeding KPI"	"1) This role requires a developer thinking mindset, and also a Project Manager thinking mindset.

A System QA Engineer is like a goal keeper, the last line of defence against buggy implementation / or implementation that dont meet either functional or non-functional requirement.

Therefore, the skillsets required for this role can be quite demanding.

2) The working hours is 10am to 7pm, some people find it a concern due to the office is located in a relatively inaccessible area (Lack of food choices within the area after evening)

3) This is a role under ""Engineering"" department, which requires 2 months of notice period if the employee ever wished to resign. It is considered longer than usual 1 month notice period.

4) For those who wanted to gain ""International exposure"" (Working abroad beyond Singapore) as career goals, this role is probably not suitable. 

Despite Shopee has QA teams abroad (Mainly in Shenzhen and Taipei), there is no known policy of transferring Singapore based employees to its local office abroad (Except its Management Leadership Programme). However as a Singapore based company, it offers work visa and PR sponsorship for people who wished to settle in Singapore.

Currently, there is a possibility for current employees based in Singapore to request for a job role changes subjected to certain performance requirements."
3937	Beware	 Analyst	23 Nov 2020	1.0	"- Free dinner (if you stay until 9pm to work); Yay?

- Company-wide outings (during non covid times)
- Fast laptop and cool welcome gifts"	"- Management only favour employees who put work ahead of everything else in life instead of taking merit-based approach 
- Overwork employees for small value-adding work
- HR will not look out for you once you are hired; do not expect them to deal with you on any work-related issues unless you are part of the problem
- Harassment and use of inappropriate language is the norm (you have been warned)
- Unhealthy blame culture instead of fixing root cause of the company's many problems
- If you resign, notice period is 3 months (way above market average)"

3940	Horrible manager and work culture	 People Team	22 Nov 2020	1.0	Good office facilities and employee benefits	"Having a vile manager who loves to micro-manage in the eyes of ""Efficiency"", when all she actually cares about are internal politics that might be about her. Extremely 2-faced and hypocritical as well.

When other team needs help, we are actually obligated to help, and they would also shamelessly make us do their job without an ounce of gratitude or appreciation. 

Reporting officer title for show, no say or authority in anything. No decision-making power as well, literally like a pet to its owner with a golden food bowl as a reward for being a ""good boy"" all these years. 

If you want an internal transfer, be prepared to stay in your current dreadful position for 3 years first before you want to consider any transfer, and it's not even guaranteed. Basically, just put on a facade and try to get into the good books of your manager first, same goes for career progression. Wait for at least 3 years maybe. 

If you are not from a local uni, be prepared to be low-balled, don't say I didn't warn you. This company is full of foreigners, China people mostly. Have to give it to China people for being extremely smart and hardworking, but a handful of them are damn entitled. Personally, feel this sense of entitlement is manifested in this company for worshipping them.

We have at least 50 new hires every WEEK, because turnover rate is ridiculously high but of course it's justifiable."

3980	Be Proactive to Succeed	 Relationship Manager	29 Oct 2020	4.0	"1. Dynamic and high potential industry, so adapting to changes is something the company is good at
2. Adapted well to the pandemic
3. Excellent L&OD trainings (local and regional) for personal and professional growth
4. Internal databases and resources are extremely useful and highly efficient
5. Great place to grow in character since the stress really tests your resilience - but you have to be proactive if you want to progress your career. Ask for opportunities, be observant of openings/PIC roles, and make yourself recognized. Don't shadow around and expect career growth to be handed to you on a silver plate. 
6. Fun, start-up culture
7. Especially with the WFH set-up, inter-regional/inter-cultural dialogue happens a lot
8. Highly data-driven"	"1. A lot of the tasks are manual and tedious
2. Overtime is a culture. The ""We Run"" value of Shopee can tend to glorify overworking oneself, even though that may not be organization's intention.
3. Initiatives tend to be overly competitor-centric, especially in the PH context wherein e-commerce is a duopoly. I feel that this isn't necessarily bad since looking out for competitors is important in any industry, but upper management must be very transparent in communicating the purpose and initiatives well to the rest of the employees. The purpose gets lost in translation often given the intense amount of tasks we need to do.
4. [Could be a pro or a con, depending on how you see it] All functions expect proactiveness, diligence, and NEED you to be meticulous on details. People won't run after you to get things done -- you have to create a system for yourself wherein you are able to meet deadlines and do your job efficiently and of quality.
5. Career progression isn't very clear, but this can be solved by proactively communicating with your direct reporting manager often and understanding the other functions within and outside your department.
6. Comms/coordination/announcements across departments and within teams are cascaded over company group chats, so it's pretty disorganized and easy to overlook. Depends on the team and department how they organize it since each dept/team operates differently.
7. High attrition rate for Business Development Department, which says a lot about the nature of the work and the leaders."

Above pros are all not personally experienced due to covid-19 but the benefit is there.

-Great child birth sponsorship ($8000)"	"- Pathetic spouse and child coverage for insurance.
- Optical and dental benefits as good as none.

Have the facade of an established MNC due to all the funding they get but they are really just a start up.

Micromanaging like crazy, enforce that you must turn on camera for video calls, even for those calls with crazy amount of attendees (50>). Their excuse is to give more ""office-like"" feel but really, it's just to make sure you are in front of your pc during the entire course of meeting (1-2 hours). On the topic of meeting, you will be required to attend irrelevant meeting that takes up your work time then expect you to do unpaid OT to finish up your task.

Good name on resume but bad experience on work life. They may offer a higher salary, especially for fresh grads but that is just to trap you in because other companies won't pay as high. Once you're trap, they can overwork you however they want and you can't do anything about it because you can't find another job that pays as well due to your lack of experience. You can't leave unless you take a pay cut, but if you are experienced hire then it's not as bad. Think carefully before joining."

4024	Job	 Product Manager	5 Oct 2020	4.0	Very young and competitive environment	Bad work life balance and workload too high
4025	Poor Mentorship	 Retail Analytics	4 Oct 2020	3.0	Fast paced and challenging environment that forces you to learn quickly.	Poor management. For those with little experience in the industry, the mentorship of managers here are really poor. While it is important for every professional to be able to learn things on their own, the poor ability of management to provide context regarding the objective of each task encourages employees to just do tasks for the sake of doing it rather than really learning about the role. This in combination with management.
4026	No one will give you work support, Never Leave on Time	 Fraud Specialist	1 Oct 2020	1.0	"Snacks Prepared at office
Food Prepared on Monday"	"1.Manager told me ""We do not encourage work life balance"" face to face. 
2.If you can finish 30 tasks on time, You will have 40 the next day, until you cannot leave on time
3.Never measure task handling duration. Meaning they just judge you going back on time = not productive
4.No learning support, 2 hours Briefing and you start working. When you question, basically you dont get answer, EVEN if you ask in a group chat.
5.You learn only from your mistakes. (Good thing?) Basically your senior will be questioning you in the group chat ask you to explain, You know you did different thing from them.
6.Dont bother to have a discussion with your manager. I got reply a week later. Tried Walk to his desk to discuss but i was answered ""I expect you to know our task more thorough first before discuss"" (Err.. Thats the point, I dont know so i ask?)"

4029	Regret to join	 Marketing	30 Sep 2020	2.0	"- They burn much money so the business growth is good. Perhaps you will hear ""we already no 1 in..."" during the interview or when you submit your resignation letter.
- Fast pace"	"- No clear direction. Your leader can ask you to do many things without telling the objective, then keep complaining/criticizing it without any solution. Basically, you are expected to read their mind. 
- No prioritization. Everything's urgent, and most of the time you don't know why.
- No appreciation. At least leaders can learn to say simple 'thank you' or 'please.' I think it's quite different between treating someone as a team member, or as a servant.
- Initiatives or creative thinking? Forget it. The most important thing is to do what your boss wants. Very top-down culture. Directions can change anytime, without consideration of how much effort and energy that has been put/will be needed to change at the last minute. What's the objective or business impact? Again, no one knows."

4035	Very poor management, ugly politics and a very stifling work environment	 Anonymous Employee	26 Sep 2020	1.0	In-office benefits that include a monthly massage	The work culture is very unlike a tech/ start up company, but rather is like a 50 year old company. They treat employees like assembly line workers and not as human beings. There is little to no room for growth. HR is just a nominal figure with absolutely no power either in your career growth or in any issues you bring to their notice.

In most companies, there are bad managers but they are usually kept in check by HR from becoming too extreme. However at Shopee, HR has no oversight or visibility on what goes on within the teams, they are simply too busy with recruiting. Also, you cannot complain to HR about your manager because there is so much political BS going on, there's a chance your complaint will be traced back to you in which case your manager will show you the door. 



1. Work life balance
- E-commerce is a 24/7, 365 days business, if you’re in product/ tech etc. you may be called at any time, even while you’re on holiday 
- Not responding in group chats within ~30mins is frowned upon, they will escalate to your manager and you will get scolded. Thus you end up checking your phone every 10mins or so (over weekend, outings with friends etc) to make sure the on-going group chats do not involve you 
- Some managers are known to ""test"" new employees by sending them tasks on weekends to determine how long it takes for them to respond. Managers will use these stupid tests to form an opinion of how “hard working” they are 


2. Micromanagement 
- Shopee managers are notorious for being micromanagers. I believe this culture is largely driven top down from the C-suite leaders who tend to see micromanagement positively as ""having paying attention to detail"" 


3. Chinese culture/ language
- If you can’t speak Chinese, don’t bother joining. 
- CEO has publicly said to focus hiring on PRCs and not Singaporeans as Singaporeans tend to be ‘lazier’ i.e. complain more about work-life balance etc, which I guess is kind of true since no such thing exists in China 
- Taking long leave i.e. >5days is frowned upon. The attitude is ‘you should feel grateful you have a job here’. My managers complained about me to my peers behind my back while i was on leave for 8 days (I was getting married in another country) 
- If you’re in tech, most meetings are conducted in Chinese, PRDs are in Chinese, most dev's english ability range from poor to none at all



4. Unprofessional team leads/ managers 
- Some managers even publicly scolded their team members for: leaving office on time (regardless of whether work is completed) 
- Feedback is never direct, it's always done behind people’s back or you get scolded on the office floor in front of everyone to “send a message” to others 


Team leads have little experience leading people 
Team leads are mostly appointed by being in “the right place at the right time” ~3 years ago when Shopee was a small start up, they survive by expertly managing the office politics 
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to understand the complexity of your task, frankly they don’t care until something is delayed or there is an issue. Then they will interrogate you until they can find something to scold you for
Team leads do not have sufficient experience to provide meaningful mentorship to their direct reports. Some leads have 10+ direct reports, they simply don't have the time either"

4060	Never join Regional BI	 Anonymous Employee	1 Sep 2020	1.0	The new office building is nice	"Language barrier: Majority of meetings in the regional BI are in Mandarin. It will be quite tough for people who cannot speak in Mandarin. 

Narrow career path: Brainwash is popular there and people are working extremely hard to fight for promotions while senior managers prefer hiring externals rather than promoting people internally. 

If you want to explore other departments, don’t think about it, many dirty actions are waiting for you.

Bad management: Top down culture especially being told it is top down directly in the dept. Inconsistent decision making, incapable managers with terrible micromanagement and bad scope management. Result driven and squeeze people with tight deadline while do not care about how late people are staying in the office. Senior leads care about own interests which are against company’s interests. No integrity at all.

HR is not supportive: The company does not have any independent team to hear your voice and HR likes to execute management decisions without careful investigation when unfair things happened.

Quite Big turnover rate in the dept. Because of above reasons and others reasons beyond your imagination."

Culture is very bad. Im not sure what happened. Before this is a happy place to work.  But now, not happy anymore. No wonder people ang leaving nowadays.

No personal life. It is all work, and nothing else. Say goodbye to weekend. There's no such thing. You are always working
2. Learning is great if you are a freshgrad since there are a lot of works to do. But if you already have experience, you will easily realize that the work is a looot, but repetitive.
3. Very top-down culture. You have idea? Swallow that. Only CEO idea that matters. You are there as a machine to execute.
4. Micromanagement. Even if you are a manager, you will be surprised on how much detail your works are, to the extent that you constantly ask ""I have to do this too?"" Every small microscopic detail needs approval. You will feel powerless and is just there to do what's being asked. Because of this reason, I notice that new employees who came from different companies do not stay long. It is typically freshgrads (who have no benchmark on how working does not have to mean being a slave) who stay longer.

Join Shopee if you are freshgraders. If you have experience, your experience is better used somewhere else."

"Be very careful with their advertisement on LinkedIn: They will name the position 1 or 2 level higher than it actually is. For example, they will advertise Manager position to call all Manager-level candidates into the pool, then give all candidates a test (which mean you would spend about a week to brainstorm and solve their business issues). Only after the test they will reveal that the position is actually at Senior Associate level (2 levels lower than Manager). 

So be careful if you’re a conscious candidate and don’t want to give them free advisory just to receive back an unpleasant experience."

- With political mindset, there is always an opportunity to get close to the manger and the role that you play.
- Manager begins brainwashing team members in cult of his as early as the first day you join. This team is more like an communist in army camp. 
- Search and RCMD are rational fields but with this irrational lead....things can go very complicated.

- Social events and team outings are not uncommon in Shopee

2. Fast-paced eCommerce industry promotes a good amount of individual growth and understanding of what's in store for the future of retail

3. Good place to grow one's network as one gets to connect with people from different walks of life"	"1. Little to no career progression prospects
- This is true especially for local employees in the PH as Shopee likes to hire expats to fill roles instead of promoting dedicated existing workers
- Shopee hires a lot because of the very high turnover rate (possibly due to the first reason)

2. Distasteful Office Politics from Upper Management
- can be attributed to reason 1 as well
- Expats hired in upper management end up hiring more expats instead of promoting dedicated existing employees

3. The company is merely a disruptor to it's competitor, Lazada
- every single action taken by Shopee is geared towards beating Lazada, despite it being at the expense of their employees and sellers
- the company is merely a disruptor in this sense. Which is why instead of focusing on developing its people and constituents, Shopee merely focuses on implementing quick band-aid solutions instead of having long term plans in developing the company and it's people further. All because they really have to beat Lazada.

4. Uneven ratio of Workload and Pay
- You may be given a significant amount of workload and roles compared to another employee, however he/she can be paid the same or sometimes even more
- better to come in the company as someone with experience rather than a fresh grad if you are looking for high pay
- Having even a sliver of extra work experience can mean having double the salary compared to a fresh grad, despite having the exact same role as them"

Vibe and work stations are well design.
Working with one of the best team managers in Shopee.
Toilets and environment are always clean.
Company is growing as a whole, will have new departments and all for you to learn more."	"Management does not know the target they would like to achieve. Hence cannot provide KPI for most of the staffs. No clear career progression, very hard to go for higher rank despite achievement and years of experience working in Shopee.
HR is not doing their part to improve our working condition, they keep hiring people but the desk did not increase desk space as fast, I can forsee we will be cramping everywhere after Covid ends. 
HR is does not allow feedbacks and cannot handle criticism. They closed the company group chat because too many people complaint in it. But they did not address to those complaint or even respond to the complaint within the group chat, of course people will be complaining. Now they closed it, all the complaints that can be settled internally will be open to public in Glassdoor / jobstreet etc. 
They are also very slow in hiring process even for urgent positions. Whenever we refer our friends in they did not even responded to our request and rejected. Even friends who previously worked as sellers in Shopee also failed their first screening for urgent position. 
Pay is definitely on the low end. For current employee you can try to search for the same task and being offered better pay somewhere else.
There is no increment of annual leave even after working here for years.
Biggest favouritism is where Ian only focus on BD and Marketing. BD team at times can make mistakes costing the company up to 100K++ losses but was not penalized or taken action upon. Promoting a culture of ""no big deal"" making such mistakes from their end.
They have L&D department but its useless as we are deeply understaffed and managers will not approve you to go for any training."

Worst part is when you are tasked to do something and is already in the midst of it, another set of instructions can arrive all of a sudden resulting in you changing the entire way you are doing the current task, which is really frustrating and time wasting
- some departments have great culture difference; there are some depts which comprises of mostly China internationals and as much as I have to agree they are good and responsible in their work, you will still feel left out if you join such department due to the culture difference, and worst, language barrier. Some documentations are written in chinese and meetings held in chinese too
- not much to no career progression if you looking to move upwards as the manager levels are mostly 30s"
4137	Unethical company	 Anonymous Employee	4 Jun 2020	1.0	Not Much Pros to begin with except you learn how to lie to big customer clients, cut throat approach in the interest of big bosses.	"Top Management highly unethical as they dismiss employees for the simplest reasons such as joining their own contests which they did not state pre-hand that employees cannot join these contests. The whole company went into full mode investigation to even track employees who joint their ""Shopee Quiz"". Once they found out that the Country Manager of Malaysia played this game as well, they only targeted lower ranking individuals and kept hush hush about taking action on senior managers and above."
4138	Productive team, highly competitive	 Senior Product Manager	31 May 2020	4.0	Highly productive in launching new features. Nice office, friendly colleagues	Working style is not so structured. Sometimes a bit political
4139	No proper management	 Associate	30 May 2020	1.0	Free snack will be only good thing.	"In my department, team lead is a person who lack of leadership and management skills. She can't well manage her own team and can't even protect her own team, she set her own expectation to her team member but herself broke all. Come late everyday, simply throw new task without guiding you. Disappear when we need her, but when she need you no matter midnight or weekend still will texted you. Ask us to done her report and she just use our hard work to show her head and MD. She wont accept any advise, just a ego person who just care her own performance. She can't assign right thing to right person. 

Diff jobscope when interview and after you join, they just lie you to hope you join the company 

Workload is crazy, everyday work more than 12hr, but when ask HR help, HR will just tell you there is no policy on this and advise you talk to your team lead. But the team lead know, she just dont care about your workload and keep throw you new task.

Means HR dont help at all when facing this problem and just push you back to settle yourself.

Now i dont understand why we need so many HR in HR department and dont understand why will have a person who obviously not suitable as Lead become a team lead.

Everyone suffer."

I applied for another position, but offered another post, but too late to turn back as I rejected other offers and job market now is terrible. I'm staying because I need the money for my family.

"1. Chinese kingdom. Apparently Shopee is a Chinese dominated company where even documents are Chinese. Managers will speak Chinese to their Chinese peers from China. So you cannot understand what they say, which alienate non-Chinese so much. And this also means non-PRC Chinese are not considered as leaders cuz they are not in the social circle.
2. top-down management. no discussion, you just receive order, and then do do do. the so-called tech lead will check your progress every 1 hour.

No clear vision from CEO. Micromanage."
4196	Wasted Potential	 Associate	9 Mar 2020	1.0	"- Pretty decent compensation & benefits
- pantry stocked most of the time"	"- The fact that most of the reviews about the pros of working in Shopee is mainly compensation based speaks volumes about the culture of the people here. It feels like the only reason most people work here/retain here are because they are paid adequately enough to forgo the ugly parts of the company. As it stands, it feels like I'm only here to do my job adequately enough just to collect salary, I wouldnt 'champion' working here to others.
- The mass hiring rate means that most of the time, new hires were made just to meet numbers rather than showing the right profile culture & competency wise.
- There is a top down feeling of toxicity as well where people generally see the worst in each other and often display either two faced treatment/favourtism
- They like to advertise how 'fun' or 'innovative' it is in here to portray the image of a company that is willing to try new things, but that is far from the case internally. Most new suggestions are often turned down by people in more senior positions because 'its now how we usually do things here' or 'we always did it this way instead'
- Shopee's standard response to negative feedback is alway 'we are still a startup', which quite frankly cant be further from the group. Although Shopee is less than a decade old, according the Malaysia SME Corp guidelines, startups are supposed to be less than 6 months of operation.. We are also strongly financially backed and have a strong presence in multiple countries across south east asia and brazil as well. How can we still go forward with this 'start up mentality' if we are already such a global brand?
- HR displays a sense of toxicity as well in that they always assume the worst in the rest of the people. When people ask genuine questions, its always retorted sarcastically or in disgust. There is also a lot of talking behind other employees back as well. As a function that is supposed to champion the needs of employees without forgoing business needs, it feels like the HR here always assumes and expects the worst of the company while putting themselves on a high stool.
- Company wants to retain talent, yet are not necessarily taking action in initiatives that will address this. It feels like the only way Shopee can think to retain people is to throw things at them during special occasions/celebrations, but even then, budget cuts means the quality of things get worst each time.
- I dont think i even need to go into work-life balance as the working hours here are so rigid we even have to tap in and out each time to have our attendance recorded. Feels like high school all over again, even college/uni didnt require us to do something like this.

I've been here less than a year and I already feel all these things, and my review is not the only one that mentions these things."

If you land in a good team/manager you’ll enjoy the work and don’t mind the occasional OT"	If you go into a team with a bad manager you’ll feel the subtle lack of respect for you and your time. Sometimes outright as well, you’re there to do work for them that’s it. A lot of big ego managers around that say they want your contribution but if you have opposing opinion get ready to shut up and nod along. There are a few notorious ones in every team, people transfer out of their teams just to get away.

- Not sure if it is due to the company or the management but there is lot of forcing  and one way communication.
- Unnecessary after work meeting which can be done within working hours. 
- The longer you stay there,  you will realized how the job is sucking your soul.

"Lately, HR has come to learn of its bad reviews on glassdoor and has made every employee write 5 start ratings back on glassdoor. Is very evident with the sudden increase of positive review in the past 2 weeks.

Also dislike the patronising replies by HR to some of the negative feedback left by employees. Seriously, were they truly ""shocked"" and ""surprised"" by the negative sentiments? Either the HR staff are totally not in-sync with the company culture or just being hypocritical on keyboards, either way, is telling of the company culture when HR behaves in such an unprofessional way.

Absolutely distasteful and disgusting."

With Shopee its like falling in love. 1st month, you'll be all over Shopee. 6th month you start to see flaws. After a year - you'll be completely out of love. And before you'll be able to complete be out of love with Shopee - its too late, they already have someone to replace you. At least, I can guarantee you'll be able to stay in Shopee for a year :) Its a fun and energetic team eventhough its toxic.  

- Used to have tea time, now no more :("	"- With above point, they hire new people most of the time - they don't groom their internal. So can forget about career progression if you join here.  Like I said, stagnant. 

- When they say they hire multiracial, ask them the percentage of at the 3 main races in Malaysia. You'll be able to tell how 'multiracial' they are. 

- HR internally is corrupted and integrity is not their thing. i.e Decision been made cater to their own opinion, biggest issue - change of policy, change of contract clause. 

- There's OT allowance, but not applicable to those earn > RM3000. But expected to work extra hours. Great! #LifeAtShopee

- Young, fresh hire. Sounds fun? Indeed. However there's a fine line between young and matured hires. Nothing is wrong to hire fresh grad and give them position that requires prior experience. But, it is wrong to give authority and power to the inexperience employee. No advantage if you have experience cos they don't know how to appreciate. Maybe upper management have insecurity issue."

4211	Shopee worth a better score on Glassdoor	 Anonymous Employee	10 Feb 2020	5.0	"This is my first time to submit a company review. After reviewing a few negative reviews on complaining about our working hours, I cannot stop myself to submit my opinion here. 

I am sitting near the internal staircase and quite near to the exit. Every day, I saw a lot of employees leave the company at 6:00 or 6:15. And I am pretty sure they are not coming to work before 10:00. 

Our suggested working hours are from 9:30-12:30, 12:30-2:00 lunch break, 2:00-7:00. 

After being with the company for more than 1.5 years, I really saw the improvement of it.

Maybe they tend to lure you in with free lunches, “pantry” supply and freebies every now and then, but trust me when I say that will be taken away very fast"	"Where do I start?
1) HR is most definitely biased, racially inclined and do not actually take actions against employees that break rules.
2) Team leads who do not know their job are hired and promoted despite them not contributing to the team
3) Company does not respect maintaining employee privacy

4215	Life at shopee - Horrible work-life balance	 Business Development	20 Jan 2020	2.0	Modern Office. youthful environment. Great location - convenient to restaurants, public transport, car parks.	"Imbalance age group, volume of freshgrads higher than experienced employees. Company is still 4 year old new start up, process and structures are unstable,  works individually. Very minimal engagements with direct reports. 
Daily fire fighting, issues are repetitive, management always procrastinate when comes to solving operations but gets ambitious  on business growth, New hires are left aside to self learn / self adapt. 
Horrible work-life balance,  never ending ad hocs, unplanned added campaigns with high achievement expectations. 
On campaign days (once a month), employees are expected to stay up till mid night 2am, take rest for a few hours and are expected to arrive by 730am the next day, continue pushing for more than 12 hours. Health deteriorates."

Have a very stupid idea that want all the new employee did a performance on some special day and it is compulsory, means even you hate performance you still will be force to do that if not they will threaten you said you will count as absent. And you will have a exam, if you fail you better quit because you will always in probation. Yes , I feel it is a threaten too. The day I join until now, I never have enough time  to sleep. No even have time to go for lunch and dinner. And yes, management still want you “compulsary” do performance and exam. It will take your time to attend meeting, to rehearsal. And yes, your workload make you stress, your exam your performance make you extra stress. I don’t understand what is the purpose. To make your employee more stress ?

4225	Having an elitist mentality despite being a startup/young company	 Anonymous Employee	10 Jan 2020	2.0	No office politics, everyone is generally nice	"Throw away all your pre-conceived impressions of Shopee out the window. Fancy new office, gym, fully stocked pantry etc..

Once you take that away, Shopee is nothing but a company that micro-manages its staff, over-working them, stingy when it comes to compensation and extremely elitist when it comes to hiring. The first thing they consider is if you have upper tier honors/from local uni or not.

They are not like this initially. I think they need to re-evaluate their position and stop sticking their heads up in the clouds. 

I have friends that were rejected from Shopee, simply because they do not go to a local university. They would much rather hire a fresh grad from a local uni.

Secondly, career progression is vague. There is no clear charted path for you from your manage despite discussions. Performance review is based on arbitrary ratings and KPI's were not clearly defined.

Thirdly, there is no work life balance. Half days on major holidays (CNY etc) is subjected to Manager's approval. And half days are from 3pm onward. If you were to take leave, its equivalent to an entire day off. 0 flexibility.

The style of working as well, is very very very micro. Weekly lengthy reports done on Powerpoint slides (smh) and having meetings with CEO every single week. You would expect a company that is supposedly made up of young millennials to function a little better, but its working like a giant local  SME lol"

4234	Terrible if you cannot speak Chinese	 Anonymous Employee	18 Dec 2019	1.0	Office is aesthetically pleasing and there are free snacks/ drinks.	If you are in a tech role, it can be more or less guaranteed that your meetings will be conducted in Chinese due to the high number of PRCs in similar roles in Shopee. I think this is a major concern as Chinese is the main language of communication and if Shopee still hires non-Chinese speaking people to fill roles that require close working relationships with these PRCs, how can it be expected that they can perform well if they cannot even communicate well? This is extremely demoralising for non-Chinese speakers. Some PRCs do not even have sufficient English speaking skills to be able to carry out a conversation. I think it should be made clear during interviews that proficiency in Chinese is mandatory (at least be upfront about it!) and Shopee should not offer someone a job if they know that they cannot speak Chinese well. Requesting the PRCs to speak English during meetings just blatantly widens the cultural gap and as mentioned, some cannot even conduct meetings in English. This has been raised in previous reviews but I don't think anything has been done to improve the situation. However, it definitely needs to be looked into and I hope that Shopee HR and management take this seriously.

When you work, you will be required to do many different things eventually. management ask growth and chase about it but they are reluctant to hire more people in team. So each people has so many tasks/responsibilities out of the scope that they started with. Also, for manager or upper level role, they only hire INSEAD MBA graduates or ppl with consulting background. Shopee does not respect person who worked from ground who knows e-commerce and has related experience. They prefer people from MBA and consulting with no e-commerce or related field experience and let them manage team. You need to be lucky to meet nice boss, otherwise some bosses are cruel to their team.  (Chasing you even on weekends or when you are on leave) : these explain high turnover rate of Shopee.

Business Development	19 Jun 2019	3.0	"- As a fast-growing e-commerce (marketplace) startup in SEA especially in Indonesia, it can be a platform for employees to grow as new ideas are very welcomed. You can be creative and sound your voice without worry of getting unfriendly smirk from your colleague as also they are mostly still young (20s)

-You will never be out of food. 3 times meal per day and snacks are always available not only at the pantry but in small corners of each office floor.

-The company gives many extras like fitness program, employee voucher for shopping and entertainment, team bonding program, etc. Oh! PlayStation and Pingpong are provided at the office, as well."	"-High pressure and fast-paced environment. During campaign period, you need to work in a very long hour everyday for few weeks! without overtime pay! SOP are still oftentimes revised, it may confuse the employees.

-Hard to level up as it seems like only accepting  C-level candidate who holds master degree from universities abroad."
4312	Young vibrant culture under dictatorship	 Senior Associate	18 Jun 2019	4.0	There are a lot of events, welfare benefits and workshops going on so it's always very lively in the company. There's not much hierarchy compared to corporate world.	Top management can be quite affirmative. Lack of documentation. Some systems or data can be quite messy and disorganised.

4325	Bad Management & Lack of Opportunities	 Customer Service Representative	20 May 2019	1.0	Free snacks and some fun team members.	Bad management, lack of opportunities, Chinese only company means lots of politics and you will need to have thick skin to survive them.
4326	Complete Chaos - STAY AWAY	 Middle Management	20 May 2019	1.0	Things more quickly(too quickly) and you get experience in different areas of work with authority as long as it is what the boss wants.	"Yes man culture.  If you have an opinion or like discussing alternatives before a decision is made, forget about this place.  The only people that survive here and get promoted are the ones that say yes without challenging the MD.  

Workload is crazy and you are expected to work extra hours with no compensation including weekends and public holidays.  Leads will bug you on 3 different messenger apps not including email and you are expected to respond no matter what.  Zero visibility on why decisions are made and you are encouraged not to question authority and just execute tasks.  Leadership rarely makes public addresses to the staff.  Almost zero mentorship culture from seniors as everyone is too buys working.  Team politics is high.   

Shopee is full of high potential young people, but office environment is colder than some larger corporates.  If you want to work here and have a family, personal life, children, hobbies or anything outside of work, forget about it."

- friendly colleagues. Less politics than other corporates out there
- interesting projects due to fast growth of the company
- free dinner and snacks, gym subsidies etc.
- management is open to views when in times of trouble (e.g. hordes of people leaving)"	"Most comments I've read for SG office are true. The HR person online will say it's a serious allegation that they'd like to address in this forum, but the truth is they know about ALL these existing problems. They just might not be able to do much about it as not management's top priority to fix. Fair enough -- every company has their own problems. So please don't leave a message pretending you'd like to fix things you know you can't.

- CEO wants to dictate everything. Leads to a Yes-man culture where people are generally afraid to voice their own opinions
- Company is bad with diversity. Every time I pass them a non-Chinese person's resume I almost always get a response that they're not suitable despite the resume being solid, and you see less stellar candidates being interviewed instead (HR will never admit this but this company pretty much only hires Chinese or Southeast asians, with unofficial claims that we work together better because we're more similar in culture)
- Career progression largely depends on your boss to fight for you. Nothing is laid out clearly  in this regard
- Mentorship and guidance isn't great. In general I'd say there's a lack of good talent in the industry as it's only up and coming"

- Your day ends after 7 pm. If you want to get free dinner, you have to stay later.
- This company is full of people from PRC and most of them speak terrible English. They speak Chinese everywhere so you may feel isolated since you don't know what they are talking about. BTW most managers are from PRC.
If you love PRCs, this can be a good place for you."

4344	Upside-down	 Operations Associate	27 Mar 2019	1.0	Amazing pantry and competitive salary	"Working at Shopee was nightmare to me. It was one of the company that I was not hesitate to leave even, since training. People were just so toxic

During training:
1) Snob and condescending trainers that love to use vulgarities and ""sex"" toys for examples and make us really uncomfortable 
2)  Condescending and always said ""I'm going to ask questions that you don't even know what to answer
3) Childish-- lacks of professionalism, after we wrote reviews on the training sessions, trainers have the access to read it?
4) This explains why 5 people resigned during training

When on the floor
1) We didnt even have on-boarding session, how to access HRIS, claim process etcs
2) No transparency in terms of salary, for public holiday you will get different rate. email HR, no replied.
3) Non-professional team manager
Took (Enjoyed?) Lunch break more than an hour
4)Manager shouted just because he/she can shouted?
5) While operation almost died during campaign (short breaks were denied because of the workload was overwhelming) other levels were having fun. Operation team have to use their money for those who had break outside the ""free meal time"" and compensation, because you know, we are just slave.
6) Last minute force OT, even though clearly stated those who earn more than 3K cannot claim OT, and suddenly have to do OT."

4349	Fun but....	 Marketing	15 Mar 2019	2.0	Had really great teammates. People here is young so you kinda have same vibes with them. Working environment is great. Proper facilities, variety of snacks, drinks and food.	"Managers here likes to extend employees probation. A few of my team members faced this. They will keep whatever lacking in your performance until the date you're supposed to confirm, then you'll receive email mention that your probation got extended. This doesn't make sense. Probation period is where you should utilize the time to follow up and improve whatever lacking in you subs performance. We don't waste 3 months just to inform employees about the extension. Then another 2 months for so called Coaching which doesn't really helpful when people felt discouraged and will leave the company.

Very limited career advancement if you got hired for entry level, and you'll stuck at the lowest hierarchy of the team and you can see how seniors will treat you differently.

Kinda racist managers and hiring team. Non Malay got more opportunities to higher position. ie: both fresh grad similar degree course, no working experience other than internship, but non-Malay got offered to higher position, while this Malays only got offered to lower position in the team."
