19	Change is the only constant, not for everyone	 Key Account Manager (KAM)	10 Feb 2023	1.0	Good salary packages and benefits	- Toxic working environment with minimal support from your line managers, especially during peak business periods, but they expect you to pick up and perform swiftly - Favoritism and unprofessional higher-ups - Analog working style as they are not in sync with G-suites - Messy and lack of streamlined process causing double work for everyone - Have to stay up very late for consecutive days during the double-digit period - Do expect office politics

30	It's a Chinese company now	 VP Operations	27 Jan 2023	2.0	The colleagues are great and the work place environment is a cosy place to work.	There are so many non Chinese colleagues but during conversation with the China team meeting, it will turn out to be Chinese conversation meeting. Plus there is no clear direction from top mgt leaving everybody clueless with leaders keep changing every year. The road map and mission statement always never aligned resulting conflict. And the bosses from China always like to finger point rather than solving the immediate situation.

32	Toxic Culture	 Operations Manager	26 Jan 2023	5.0	Fair compensation. Relative to other conpanies within the same industry or endeavor, the pay, I should say, is more generous. Business model, organizational structure, and facilities are cut above the rest.	Tenured employees are very territorial especially to newly onboarded managers. Too much crab mentality, silo-thinking, back-stabbing, and politics. Superiors are also overly condescending and obviously one-sided when it comes to listening and gathering feedback.

34	Change is the only constant	 Manager	26 Jan 2023	4.0	It's the place to learn e-commerce (platform) and the driving force behind it (user growth, seller growth, product assortment, dynamic pricing, fulfilment etc.). Regardless of which department or function you're attached to, the exposure to the business is almost direct. Great for learning. Love the mega campaign seasons. It's hectic, but everyone works towards a common goal.	The relentless pursuit for more growth (not unexpected) layered with unnecessary constraints from group/regional doesn't go hand-in-hand most of the time, or at all. Some constraints are okay. But some were outright ridiculous (i.e. no hiring due to lack of demonstrated growth). When commercial roles are bogged with administrative tasks that takes up 70-80% of their time. This is not a good use of their time/resource.

2. Preach and doing it is so different

4 Yet Cainiao is duplicating the business and working on lazada leads yet didn't contribute much to lazada only for Cainiao benefits
5. The hidden internal politics is confusing everyone on the ground. So are we working as lazada direction or only leading towards Cainiao directions?
6. Plus Cainiao directors to lead lazada business growth in lazada South East Asia Yet didn't provide a concrete road map to review better strategy for lazadians.
7. The HR is a problem here...lack of clear directive when looking for candidates...people come people go with such high turnover causing the VP and SVP so many issues on the ground. 
8. All founders have left the company and now only a few around waiting for cash payout...then what's the point of telling everyone that lazada will be listed? Yet vesting the shares out..everyone has yo pay high tax again?"

- Decks and decks of sop which are not aligned among all department which results in lots of miscommunication.
- not all but there are several higher-ups which are clearly incompetent at all sitting comfortably in places giving out orders without direction, unable to solve problem or give solutions/ advices as well. But goes all raging when problems are actually solved independently or among the lower rank staffs for not ""going through"" them. Nonetheless, there are still some amazing leaders from other department who will always be willing to guide and help
- HR needs to be more transparent and proactive in listening to the feedbacks of the staffs, rather than turning a deaf ear or ignoring the problems thats happening in particular departments such as MS team. Despite having several red flags known/ flagged by all other department and past employees
- Overall is a good company, but having several red apples sitting in spots totally destroy the experience or growth prospect of employees particularly MS."

Good experience for resume and growth

Your race/gender/sexual orientation will not be a factor as they look for skills and GMV instead of personal differences"	"Performance appraisal and bonus is not transparent - you might achieve more than your KPIs but still be graded meeting expectations. The bell curve system is unfair as someone else doing better than me doesn't mean i'm not good and don't deserve a better grading. A lot of people actually leave Lazada because of this

Some management personnel are underqualified for the role. They might have rose to the position due to time spent in Lazada/ relationship with higher ups

Management tend to micro-manage a little with their spontaneous ideas

Pay disparity can be quite huge even for people with the same role and responsibilities

Sometimes can be quite disorganized due to the lack of coordination between functions (but this is also due to the urgent timeline for many projects)

498	Life Below the Powerhouse as Local Software Engineer	 Software Engineer	20 Nov 2021	3.0	"You have the flexibility to do exploration and build your own product as you may have the capability to access the stack to the tech giant even though sometimes it may be limited due to several constraint and especially the scale. You will have the right to analyze, offer, and implement your best solution here which sometimes the simplest solution can lead to big contribution to company and it's exciting.

If you're interested in something, there will be a proper private learning class which you can take and do self development which is super useful, as you can actually learn anything in there from engineering, product, even the non-engineering part is accessible there. 

Most of the time it will be like a startup level bootstrapping as you will have so many discussions and understand the business flow and background properly which makes you not only as an engineer, but also the business / product owner.

You have good allowance for transportation and phone bill which vary on each position / levels and also you have quite good work life balance (unless you will need to have a shift or overtime during events, you may get leave benefit though)"	"At certain point, your skill level will not be a caliber of higher level engineer as the main technological stack is already in place from the parent company / regional and not accessible unless it's related to you. Most of the time you will be a lone wolf as the team is too lean or maybe lackluster which if you don't have the initiative and commitment to grow, you will just be another person that will be easily replaceable and a contributor to the high number of the turnover. There is no such thing as nurturing and pair programming / review, and other beautiful things as you hope in engineering. Do your own stuff, grow yourself, ask someone, find something on the documentation (even though most of them might not be readable, you can use google translate on the documentation page hoping that it's understandable). Some people are helpful, some might just want to do their own business. 

Everyone has their own pride, there will be a case that you build a redundant product instead of working together to achieve something causing the lost of resource of manpower and other imaginable bad things in this case. 

There will be some days that you won't be an engineer, but more like an operation based worker which needs to help low level issue but very long process need to be passed which usually some of the process are actually a pass through process which is quite useless. (if you want to grow as a real software engineer, go apply to regional in Vietnam instead of on local level venture)

Sometimes you will be dragged to some random meeting which has no point and clarity because on venture level and you will be facing so many operation or business minded people instead of tech based people which you might get lost on what you want to build due to some drives from the business. Meaning if you don't do something visible to operation based, you can be regarded as no contribution.

Meeting may happen / most likely to happen right after office hour because there might be too much job for the upper level management which impacting the lower level position from senior -> mid -> junior level might need to follow the higher ups.

It might just be a matter 
of time that the local tech team will be disbanded and absorbed somewhere else."
499	Vibrant working place, am in a good team	 Operations Associate	18 Nov 2021	4.0	Guidance available, decent laptop, flexible work hour	Workload increase faster than headcount hiring
500	Good learning	 Vice President	18 Nov 2021	4.0	It is a mixed culture of Chinese culture in the product team. We have the chance to learn the latest e-commerce technology in the market trend.	Chinese language is an added advantages.
501	Do your research before joining	 Team Member	17 Nov 2021	1.0	"- Opportunities to learn about e-commerce industry
- Internal rotation is not difficult. It is encouraged after 2 years
- Essentially a Chinese company - can be a pro or a con depending on what you are comfortable with"	"- Most of the middle managers do not possess leadership qualities. No holistic performance review system (there is only top-down), which is odd because the company is not that young anymore. Some people managers are really toxic, but no one does anything about it because the upper management is ignoring this problem and likely unable to find solutions anyway... A lot of decent people managers have left the company. Some of the remaining people managers who are pretty decent try their best but the working environment and culture is just not supportive.
- Lack of direction. Lots of the work bring little or no impact to business. A lot of time is spent on meaningless manual work which does not really benefit anyone or the business. Other than the manual work, a significant part of people's time is spent by chasing or being chased over some Excel trackers. The company is still fixing issues that they should have done a few years back (you may now be wondering....what the company is spending time and money on...)
- Strong Chinese culture in the regional team (again, can be a pro or a con). Only a group of people from the parent company are empowered to make decisions, unfortunately these people do not have the time to make all the important decisions. Meanwhile, the middle managers are too afraid to make decisions because they cannot afford to lose their jobs if anything goes south.
- Lack of inclusion. Inability to communicate in Chinese is a huge barrier for progression in certain teams.
- ""Change is the only constant"" is one of the company values. Unfortunately, a lot of people misunderstand what it is supposed to mean. In reality, implementing too many and frequent changes results in inefficiencies and people leaving sooner than expected."

- A lot of Chinese being used. Most of my group chats had the auto translation on, so it's fine but sometimes during video chats, they even breaks out into Chinese for a good while. You can imagine how it will make the non Chinese feel. And it feels like everything could have been done a lot faster if everyone just spoke Chinese.

- Managers are literally managers, don't expect leaders. They are just there to assign and probe you for your tasks. My voicing out of work concerns are met with deaf ears. Did not feel like I can approach manager for any troubles.

- Disgusting welfare efforts. There's almost no welfare. The most you'll get is an email (in Chinese) about how everyone is working hard and to keep it up. Absolute clownery. 

- Flexible hours also mean you could get pinged during your leave and routine OTs. Say bye bye to your WLB.

- Pay was high for fresher. But you forget about your pay when you're knee deep in stress and anxiety. Unless you're in dire financial needs, trust me, it's not worth it."

The internal environment is free of politics. It is fast paced and the attitude is to get things done, quickly."	The leadership of Lazada is in shambles. The current group CEO - Chun Li - seems to be on not able to set the vision or provide a clear strategy. The company performance has been slipping over the past 12 months, losing share to competitors who are executing well. Chun doesn't seem to have any ideas nor the energy or charisma to lead the organization forward against this loss to competition. Attrition is very high, most people are leaving due to lack of direction and winning spirit. Lazada Indonesia (where Chun Li is also the CEO) is in a worse shape than rest of Lazada Group.

senior management mostly is from Alibaba, does not have leadership quality such as good presentation skill, set strategy vision, English communication skills and leadership. they might be experts in e-commerce, but hardly you could see them to be employed in senior positions in any other companies.

I've been in Lazada for almost 2 years and with the people I regularly work with, I'm used to placing my trust in them because they have proven so but this is a different experience. After expressing my opinions about salary, management direction, and some other personal stuff. I got a message from my manager asking me what's wrong with me and why didn't I told him first instead of telling the HRBP. 

Now in this case, I'm not upset at my manager's scolding and now being micro-managed. I'm upset with the fact that the HRBP I trusted snitched everything I told her even regarding it as ""Confidential"". In any case I just kept it for myself because it wont really do me good if I proceed with a direct confrontation."

4. Join if you're young, has loads of stamina and has an aggressive attitude to reach hit KPI goals"	"1. High pressure environment
2. Managers manage upwards, pressure downwards to achieve goals/KPI or overall performance will be evaluated poorly resulting in high turnaround from extreme stress and high burnout rate.
3. Fast pace resulting in short term planning and relatively low long term plans for longevity, as long as KPI is met, it's time to move on to the next thing.
4. Regionally managed by Alibaba managers, has little understanding of local country's culture and marketing relevancy, thus allowing the competitor to race ahead.
5. Very cliquey, you're either in (protected) or you're out (sink or swim)

799	Nepotism is king	 Anonymous Employee	15 Mar 2021	1.0	It is an E-comm company and remuneration package including medical benefits is great.	A place filled with plenty of parachuters, sycophants and cronies. If you like being a yes man who is ok with taking the fall for useless people to get recognised, it will be the perfect place to be in. It's messy and decision makers only preach about autonomy but offer none. Alibaba has full control and staff evaluation is based on crappy values that make you laugh because they hold trainings for it but yet, the leaders in the company do not practice it. Every 3-6 months, they try to solve the problems by changing management teams and rotating rubbish in when the root of the problem is never solved. When throngs of people resign, they choose to believe that it's the people who did not fit the culture. It's a place that sucks you in, burn you out and leaves you demoralized.

1. Highly relationship-driven, favours are given to people who curry favour superiors
2. Blame culture. when something goes wrong, instead of solving problems, people are more interested in pointing fingers 
3. Lack of innovation. New ideas are seldom executed because of fear of failure 
4. There is only one ultimate decision-maker. New ideas are seldom explored unless it comes from the ultimate decision-maker, then you are left to silently execute.
5. HR is a pretext to safeguard the management's interest, not for employees. Anything told in confidence will reach your manager. 
6. Complacent and reactive to competition 
7. Misaligned objectives between teams and departments. Mostly doing things to 'look good' on paper but do not think in the interest of the company 
8. People are promoted based on relationship while allowing good people to churn. 
9. No 360 feedback, no senior people would want to promote this
10. Culturally, newcomers are set-up to fail. People enjoy bringing you down to elevate their own esteem
11. Highly incompetent managers who have no basic business acumen and no leadership traits 
12. Lack of individuals who are truly passionate about the company
13. Even after several work complaints from different people, you will never be fired as long you gain yourself the status ""friend of the office""
14. Very hierarchical and insecure managers 
15. People from other countries are more likely to render assistance than your own team members

Join only if you are beyond desperate. There is no glory in being part of Lazada SG. The competitions do not need to spare any effort in trying to win market share from Lazada. It will be Lazada's own undoing that it eventually fails. Something has to be done at the very highest to salvage whatever shred of honesty is left."

866	Read this before accepting an offer from Lazada Malaysia	 Anonymous Employee	26 Jan 2021	1.0	"- Fun place to work at with the many activities and entertainments organised by the People Team throughout the many campaigns and occasions.

Reasons to accept an offer from Lazada Malaysia:
1. Lazada is pretty much a well-established brand in SEA. Will look good on your resume.
2. You are currently unemployed and really need the money.
3. You want to experience/learn about e-commerce industry."	"- If you are currently employed, stay there. Don't accept the offer from Lazada expecting it to be better.

Reasons NOT to accept an offer from Lazada Malaysia:

1. Top down communication is at its absolute worst, causing frequent changes in directions and instructions.

2. For an e-commerce giant that's turning 9 years old this year, the management of the organisation is still very much all over the place. Departments and processes have no properly established SOPs with the endless excuse that ""this is a fast pace environment"". Yes, ""CHANGE IS THE ONLY CONSTANT"" (one of Lazada's values), but it should also be expected. Hence, the need for SOPs.

3. People managing the teams are extremely lacking in people management skills. Managers only talk to you when they need something from you, so they can take credits for the things you do. Otherwise, you don't exist to them. Zero human touch. Credits are sometimes given, but in private.

4. If you accepted a position in Lazada Malaysia, be prepared to do works entirely out of the scope of your role/experience without any guidance or training for upskilling.

5. No matter how good you are at what you do, you will never be promoted or recognised if you don't su*k up to the management of your department. Doing your work excellently alone is not enough. You'll experience major career setback.

6. No one in the organisation can be trusted, not even the HR/People Team. If you have issues, keep it to yourself. Reporting to a higher level or the HR is just a waste of time. If you do, don't expect changes.

7. Your yearly KPIs will only be given to you 5-6 months into the new financial year. I got mine just 2 days before the deadline of mid-year review submission, and yes, I did ask for it earlier but the answer is always ""waiting for management to review and approve"".

8. For an industry that relies heavily on their customers (buyers and sellers), their Customer Care department is the LEAST liked department and often overlooked. The head of the department doesn't even put in the effort to elevate the Customer Care department. 

9. The activities organised by the People Team are fun, but very rarely inclusive. Most of the time, you will feel like an outsider looking in. The participants are mostly people from the so called Malaysia Management Team (MMT), HR, Category and Marketing teams.

10. Campaigns after campaigns after campaigns, it's a vicious cycle. Expect to work at least 12 hours on campaign days for absolutely no reasons. 

11. No matter the achievements on campaign days, don't expect big bonus and increment.

The list of cons is endless, but I think I've made my points. I'm only writing this for the sake of my friends who are still stuck there, because they are not able to secure another job yet during this pandemic. Praying they will get an out soon."

Technology stack limit to Alibaba's one, we had to manage to make the best usage of what is currently supported.
903	Command-and-control management style	 Manager	9 Jan 2021	3.0	Good learning experience in e-commerce.	"Lazada is not meant for you if you want to make a positive impact on customer experience. You can also forget about building your career here unless you are Chinese, speak Mandarin, or enjoy being at the beck and call of everyone 24-7.

An unhealthy culture that glorifies long working hours, unproductive meetings, and doing whatever your boss tells you. Collaboration is not encouraged - competition is; breeding a toxic environment. People get promoted for their blinkered focus on KPIs that have no meaningful contribution to the business or the customer.

Many managers lack compassion/empathy and aren’t capable of thinking laterally - the keys to success and career progression here. Your manager will only give you the time of day if they can claim credit for your work or if their neck is on the line - every man for himself!

HR only exists to discipline supposed transgressors and silence people who ask questions or give suggestions for improvement. If you decide to accept a role here, grit your teeth, put your head down, and stick it out for at least a year. Try not to stay too long because your career will stagnate, you will feel drained, and you’ll likely lose your critical thinking skills."
904	A stressful, toxic workplace	 Anonymous Employee	8 Jan 2021	1.0	"The scale at which Lazada operates is massive. Ecommerce at this scale does not happen at many places and being associated with Alibaba makes it a good brand to have on your resume.

It is also a good place to really learn how a massive e-commerce giant works, and multiple departments like commercial, marketing and logistics come together."	"While Lazada is a really big brand, toxic work culture has crept in over the years and there are unhappy people in almost every department now. People are highly stressed and there is no spirit of collaboration between teams. Employees are under immense pressure at all times, and hence do not want to build or do anything even slightly innovative around their core jobs. During my time, I saw at least two senior managers break down in tears due to stress. There is no work-life balance and the company simply goes from campaign to campaign without taking a break.

Promotions are offered as a way to retain people who threaten to quit. Saw several people get promoted out-of-cycle this way, resulting in an unnecessarily top heavy workforce. 

There is also no proper onboarding or training offered to new hires either. This is simply dismissed as ""the Lazada way of doing things"" (actual quote from an HR generalist), but burnout and attrition are super high, so there are always new people struggling to come up to speed. People would often be hired and find out on the day they joined that their role or scope had completely been changed since their interview. 

Finally, management changes and departures are very frequent making trust and faith in the company a real issue."

If you want to destroy your physical and mental health, go ahead apply here. Because compensation is a LITTLE BIT better, they will give you a job that’s normally done by 3-5 people but here you’ll do it yourself. The reviews here saying the company is toxic, unfortunately it’s TRUE. There’s definitely no work-life balance. Management wants everything to be rushed. No proper planning with lots of initiatives but lacks a lot of people/staff causing most employees to get overworked resulting to high turnover rate so employees just want to leave

- There's no learning curve after 1 year as all the time is the same campaign again and again, so prepare your life based on them because you won't get the time you want to spend your holidays 
- HR doesn't really care about the people, the only thing they do is to sweet talk all the problems like people accumulating leaves but no time to use
- Colleagues are not challenging or motivated, everyone seems to be tired and just doing what is required not to be done but no one willing to go further because they are just tired"

- Excellent SLAs: Especially from onsite & IT support, very responsive with resolutions to issues & bugs. 

- Wide range of assortments : Very comprehensive and still growing assortments of products and brands geared towards the future. 

- Good tech system : Data, analytics, module systems are very dynamic and detailed. One of the best dashboards and platforms I ever used.

- Empowerment : Contrary to the beliefs that Lazada is top-down, I wish to clarify it's not. Clusters are given empowerment and encouraged to propose ideas and solutions to campaigns.

- Good management : The C levels know the ground, and are very responsive to competitors and macro economics factors."	"Not really cons to me, but here it goes :

- Frequent OTs: That's because of the number of campaigns ran and how we wanted to assist sellers to succeed.

- Work-life balance: Due to frequent OTs. However, I want to emphasize this can still be juggled well, if we prioritised our work properly and maturely."

It looks like clearly there are some people trying to write short reviews here with very high ratings but in related contents, while the long ones are generally giving very low rating with concrete backgrounds. I guess our own HR colleague has been trying to bring up the ratings. But hey, please do it in proper ways.

Real life history lesson - why dynasties fail in China (politics, relationships, complacency and eager to please eunuchs)"	Politics, leadership with little to no strategy, inconsistent pay bands, unprofessional managers, unclear KPI and targets, yes men, knee jerk reaction to every problem.

- Good fringe benefits"	"- NEPOTISM - If you want to grow, you need to be BFF's with upper management. You can work insanely hard for years and fail to be promoted in place of people who are buddy buddy with upper management. FORGET ABOUT ANY CAREER GROWTH.

- Close to ZERO work life balance - be prepared to basically sell your soul to the company. Don't expect to have any time for yourself, your family or friends even in the evening. Be prepared for your boss to call you at 12 midnight and ask you for work

- THE TECH IS HORRIBLE - you would think that a company backed by Alibaba would have good tech but you would be wrong. There is very limited data you can look at which makes it almost impossible to do your job

- Pointless middle management - Lazada Singapore puts Category Managers on top of Key Account Managers and all they do is baby sit instead of focus on trying to grow their categories. When Key Account Managers want to execute their work, they can't do it without the Category managers breathing down their necks. This is an example of essentially useless middle management

- No 360 degree feedback during performance reviews

- TOXIC CULTURE OF FEAR and GASLIGHTING

- Lack of direction and strategy - ""strategy"" changes every few months depending on what Shopee does."

996	Rotten	 Data Engineer	22 Sep 2020	2.0	Fast paced, smart people, hardworking individuals	"Performance review is far from being called transparent, basically you don’t get to speak for yourself at all

The middle management from alibaba don’t actually care about the success of lazada in SEA, they just need the overseas assignment to be promoted faster. So your goals would never align with theirs unless you are someone who wanna be mediocre and don’t care much about your personal growth or future opportunities.

I’m Chinese speaking but never worked in the mainland. This experience has made me believe that I should never do that, never think about getting a job back home. I can’t survive the game, and I seriously don’t wanna become someone who is into that game, I would be disgusted by myself."

2) If you get good boss, work-life balance can be easily achieved
3) Many gifts from companies"	"1) As structurally already established, too many office politics with different culture (tech is chinese culture, legal/finance is indo's culture) - confusing
2) top management is not aligning on core direction and principle - no clear direction what to prioritize. no strategy tree

95% of SVPs/EVP (promoted / hired) in Shenzhen to ensure all decisions are made in SZ and rest of the local markets can be treated as only executioners

Clear mindset of rewarding only Chinese employees and keeping non-Chinese employees uninformed about all developments.
PS: Product Managers are taught to steal work scope of other team members to ensure that you can grow in the company

Negative eNPS scores every year and that's satisfying to management because they prefer employees to be unhappy (according to them, this predicts that employees are made to work hard and hence negative eNPS which is good for Lazada)

They talk about innovation but in reality, there is zero (it's all copied from Shopee). Whatever Shoppe innovates, Lazada has to copy to just stay in the game.

Never ready to accept the fact that South East Asia is a completely different market compared to China and just keeps building product internally.

All China based Product Managers or SG based ones (moved from China) has access to documents of Taobao / Alibaba / T-Mall (written in Chinese) and they just copy paste it to build products in Lazada (and then they present it to management as innovation) so kindly be careful before you step into Lazada with any new offers."

Associate	2 Aug 2020	3.0	You get to brag about being part of the Alibaba ecosystem, relatively good pay, rathen frequent swag merch giveaways (just contributing to waste!)	Really bad management from top to bottom (mid management). The people get promoted not because of merit or that they're really competent, but because their predecessors got too sick of the situation in there and left, leaving a hole for these lackluster people to fill. Lots of title inflation, many “managers” and “VPs” don’t really deserve their titles, but are given it just because the company had to make them happy about staying on in the rotten core. Many of them will do whatever it takes to maintain their position because they got it good there, but deep down they know they didn't deserve it and can't perform in the job. Guilt can make people do funny things, including throwing their subordinates under the bus when things go wrong.

Company has so many plans with no clear direction and no clear timelines. Campaigns are scheduled with very little lead time. We understand that Lazada is adapting to the covid situation but this is not healthy for anyone. I get internal emails at 12MN and 2AM. This just means that we are all still working at this time. This isn’t healthy anymore. This could be avoided if just given proper timelines.

Horrible managers - My time here has really made cherish my past companies. I’ve been really terribly treated (talked down to, rude remarks) from several managers here just because things don’t turn out the way they want (like our COO, C*r*y Chong)."

1041	Fast paced, demanding, but highly rewarding	 Senior Associate	16 Jul 2020	4.0	Creativity is encouraged, and there is high accountability in your tasks	For someone without a background in e-commerce, learning curve maybe steep. No mentoring and you kind of need to figure things out on your own.

1047	Long Working Hours	 Vice President	1 Jul 2020	1.0	"Good from colleagues within Lazada (only for True Blue Lazadian). Getting to know people you work with is easy as everyone is a friend rather than just a colleague. 

New CEO with Li Chun taking over, hopefully it will be better, but that also mean with another round of Re-Organization"	"Working hours are freaking long. If you come in a few minutes later than 9am, you get ticked off, even for the facts that you might have stayed till 10pm on previous day. Existing Alibaba Management does not care about employee welfare, no benefits, no over time, you work continuously even on weekends, sick days and annual leave. 

The existing Alibaba Staff transferred from Hangzhou mostly having poor communication skills, thus they work more like an communist in army camp than a workplace. Basically it's a bossy environment rather than leaders with high employee turnover rate where most potential employees had left and replaced with basically anyone who has an education. 

Do not trust high rating review, existing ex-colleagues told us it was ""hired reviewers"" :)"

1050	Not a place for everyone - 5 reasons to join or avoid	 Anonymous Employee	27 Jun 2020	2.0	"1. Personal development. Plenty of opportunities to learn about a variety of functions - account management, marketing, logistics, operations, etc. Partially due to an unstructured organization - no clear roles and responsibilities. Requires willingness to take initiative to expand work beyond your job scope. 

2. Societal impact. Ecommerce in South East Asia is still in its early days. Many buyers/sellers are still conducting transactions offline. Much room to shape the development of ecommerce. To make a difference in the lives of millions across the region. Fulfilling experience if you succeed."	"3. People quality. The rapid growth of ecommerce has resulted in need for rapid hiring/promotion. Speed is prioritized at the expense of quality. Many employees lack relevant functional or management expertise required for their roles/responsibilities. Leads to poorly designed and executed projects. Can be a frustrating experience. You have to be an independent thinker to navigate around limited competency. 

4. Professional development. Superficial process and inadequate transparency during performance reviews. Promotions (or lack of it) can be unsubstantiated. Decision-makers susceptible to confirmation bias - grasping at straws to justify decisions. Exacerbates the lack of functional/management expertise in the company. If objectivity is essential to you, this may not be a company of good fit.

5. Culture. Inconsistency in words and actions. For instance, one advocates accountability, yet avoids any for themselves. Or claims to offer autonomy, yet adopts an authoritarian approach. Will depend on the importance of culture to you or your tolerance towards such."

- Above market salary, which hinges heavily on employee shares."	"- No company is perfect. 
- As the company continue to grow, there are many things that are evolving (updating technology, org. structure, formalizing policies, etc.) which are by-products of any growing company. 
- It is important not to be obsessed on what's wrong, but to focus on what is right and the progress (continual improvement) that supports the vision and direction.
- With this growth mindeset, there is always an opportunity to define the future and the role that you play.
-Like any tech companies, the company can be highly complex, and not everyone can succeed in navigating the ambiguity.

If you ever wanted to drown, this company is for you!"	"Tremendous leadership issues, tremendous privacy issues, incredibly negative corporate culture, abysmal internal communication, stifling micromanagement, mind-boggling lack of empathy from the so-called leadership, an all-pervading sense of unhappiness at the office.

1084	Just another employee that can be replaced	 Anonymous Employee	6 Mar 2020	1.0	Free food during mega campaigns	"1. Alibaba culture.  You are not valued as an employee. You are expected to work and be loyal to the company. If you are not happy in your role, find another job or role within the company. 
2. HR is bad. Their surveys measure happiness within employees but the questions asked are skewed to what's good and what's working. Group CPO Sophie is all talk and no action, she also said in the downhill Q&A that if you are not happy with your manager or your role, you can leave. HRBPs are also not doing their job. No safe environment for employees to provide feedback despite their ""openness"".
3. Local CEO does not get to know the ground and the employees. If you are not management you will be ignored. After the change in CEO, it has become very hierarchal. 
4. Many VPs and managers are hired because they want more experienced people. But most of the work are very executional which no-one wants to touch. Inexperienced managers as well who do not know how to manage a team, and are only concerned about climbing the ladder. No 360 feedback for employees as well. 
5. People in management are busy fighting their own political war. Promoting people who are on ""their side"", and if you are willing to do what it takes to be on their side you will be on a fast track for your career."

3. Culture is toxic. Toxic but high performing employees are not fired but promoted. Backstabbing to take over projects or to claim credit is common.
4. If you do not speak mandarin, you are disadvantaged as most high level decisions are make in mandarin for efficiency.
5. Decisions will be stuck indefinitely unless you know someone from the Alibaba inner circle (which makes up most of the product and technology teams).

"- Every single day that you work for this company must be considered a waste of lifetime. The high turnover rate and the toxic atmosphere at work speak for themselves.
- Leadership at Lazada is defined by intimidation, arrogance and favoritism, as well as questionable ethics.
- Dreadful, virtually non-existent communication within and between teams. I shouldn’t even use the term “team”. Teams do not exist in Lazada. You follow orders of your superiors.
- Extreme workload and terrible work-work balance. Yes, you’ve heard correctly: work-work balance. There is no life at Lazada. You are trying to balance work with more work.
- Management doesn’t understand the meaning of the words “encouragement” and “appreciation”. Their idea of rewarding excellent work is to belittle or ignore it and to focus on flaws instead."

3. dependency on alibaba's proprietary technologies, which are neither well documented nor supported.

Many of the systems in-house replaced by Chinese products that are annoying and inferior.
Plans and projects keep changing ; no clear direction from the A team often times. Regional and local direction forever misaligned. 
Products rolled out by tech teams always incomplete and not tailored for local context ; waste of time and ineffective + causes administrative pain.

As a new person, things are always going to be difficult, but in Lazada it will be even more difficult because of the toxic culture. With the instability within the organization and the high turnover rate, I have heard and seen numerous instances where promises made to get people into the company were broken the moment the person entered the company or a person's team gets restructured within a few weeks of the person entering into the company and no effort is expended to find another alternative for the new person because they are easy to get rid of while on probation. Everybody tells you that you have to be prepared for changes in this company, but I think it is important to be aware of how these changes can impact the promises made to you and your assumptions of the job when entering this organization.

3. Many VPs and above are rewarded based on their ability to play politics and find favour with the right (Alibaba) executive leaders, instead of on their work achievements. Basic Management capabilities are shockingly lacking in a lot of senior folks.

Very difficult to find such big responsibilities and roles in such a large business at even early stages of your career (still even got some C levels in their 30s)"	"Complete Chinese takeover. One by one entire functions are replaced by Chinese nationals. Especially in tech and product, meetings and emails just go out in Chinese and the rest of us have to try to do our jobs using Google translate. Senior managent say they will limit the number of Chinese nationals they bring to Singapore, so 3 months later they just open two offices directly in China to get around the policy. If you are not Chinese you cannot have a long term career. Just put your head down and don't argue. 

Decisions not made based on data or analysis. Whatever the highest ranking person made up on the spot after five minutes becomes the strategy. People under them will not try to advise them based on any actual numbers or help provide insights. This is how they destroyed Redmart. Alibaba said they need to integrate Redmart after a short meeting, so they immediately did it without taking any time to think about customer impact, how to do it smoothly or properly. Execution without insight. Within 3 months Redmart was dead.

No regard for what's right for the business. Follow the KPI your boss told you at all costs, even if it destroys business and customer experience. It doesn't matter what kind of business you have, following a KPI blindly without judgement is always bad for business in the long run. People will not do things that are easy, quick and good for the business just because their KPI didn't say it.

The worst HR function I've ever seen in my life. They don't care at all about employee welfare. Just a mouthpiece of cooperate propaganda. They tried to hire HR executives from mature companies but the last one resigned after 3 weeks of seeing how the team is run."

"Top management is unethical and dis-ingeniousness - they say pleasant things outwardly to the public, but give veiled threats to employees in private that want to propose change. 

Management also imports foreign nationals from Alibaba to force change which are against local business and cultural norms. They tacitly punish those who do not support these changes.

The company also promotes a toxic work commitment, and expects almost immediate responses via an in-house messaging app - even on weekends and public holidays. When this issue of work-life balance is brought up, management says outwardly that they want all employees to have proper rest, but C-level executives regularly send messages, emails and updates during rest hours (even as late as 12 midnight)."

1218	Top-down HR culture, outdated HR processes being forced in the company	 Human Resources	24 Mar 2019	2.0	"Fast growing e-commerce and company is one of the fastest growing.

CEO and commercial leaders have ambitious growth plan and it actually seems possible that it can be realised.

Management in commercial divisions is good, though it could be better supported by the top management to have sufficient resources for them.

For HR aspirants: This is the place for you if:
- you like to work in organisations where who-you-know matters far more than what-you-accomplish, and want to be skilled at playing politics.
- are good at showing a sense of urgency in body language, are great at making consultancy-style presentations, even if it does not have focus.
- want the brand name of Alibaba group on your CV.. and don't mind doing anything that comes with it.
- are young, under 6 years of experience, and wants to hold senior job titles without actual seniority."	"In HR: Top-down and directive work culture that is operated behind a veil of being a family.

Senior HR leaders are unable to develop focus to address most pressing needs and gaps of business. Most senior leaders set the tone of being aggressive, assert authority, and take little accountability for their own poor planning.

Has attracted people in HR who 'service' with lots of activities.. but do not know how to develop great HR initiatives.

Urgent activities all the time actually is a reflection of poor decision making and  planning by HR leaders. They show confidence, make many powerpoint slides, organise many group events, instagram photo taking, etc. But very little actual contribution to business or its people."

Good  and stronger HR team after Alibaba has helped to re-structure the organization and observe better corporate and social responsibilities.  
Product and Tech teams shared good knowledge and experience on the e-commerce ecosystem. Most of them are keen and proactive to learn SEA culture and business.
Things are fast paced but if you have a supportive team and manager, everything will work out well as long as willing to learn and work hard."	"Lack of trust and respect from Lazada ""old timers people managers"" who humiliate staff /even peers publicly whenever things  do not go according to ""their way"".  In my day to day work,  I encountered situations where these people think they are experts in all functional areas (when they are not) and start to finger point at other teams eg Tech/Finance/Product/Engineering whenever projects/plans hit into issues and  potentially impact their KPIs. Observe managers jumping into conclusions without listening to their staff explanations and giving teams a chance to explain.

Most people in certain regional functions do not know  E-commerce ecosystem and logistics operations.  Even the so called heads do not have deep expertise.
Knowing very limited small pieces here and there, they try to act like ""experts"" by doing some presentations with some nice diagrams,  mass blasting emails to copy every CEO/COO thinking they are smart and  try to market themselves,boasting when the project has not even started and no buy-in from all stakeholders yet.  With incomplete business requirements and not bothering to work hard to find out details /learning from the ground,  such projects will never be successful."

1249	4 years working in Lazada	 Senior Manager	19 Dec 2018	3.0	"I can admit, it has been a very bumpy ride. Working with so many people. Moving from local team to regional team. Seeing so many newbies becoming professionals. Experiencing managers who sacrifice their own staff to survive in the company at expense of others. 

What I find very upsetting is that majority of company problems come from its own leadership, not competition. I have never seen or imagined that so many high level profiles getting fired or booted, and not just during restructuring, it has been like from the beginning. And all of that for a reason. Company was founded from the foreign capital and nobody from leadership cared about making right decisions, they only cared about their own well being.

It really feels like internal conflict is the biggest obstruction on the way of success.

Also it is hard  to give a fair judgement for all 4 years, as some years were very bad and some were good. I would give 3 starts, because right now company has new leadership, with old leaders are moving away. Let's hope this will be a positive change.

You have everything you need to learn e-commerce:
Freedom to do a good job or a ""bad job""
Freedom from your line manager, because he doesn’t care if you do good or bad.
Access to metrics and data you need to develop yourself into professional.
You can meet talented experts and occasionally amazing managers."	"Politics surround you from the first day: local versus regional, sales versus operations versus, us versus them.
Nobody cares about your achievements: if you expect to be recognized or promoted, well you will never get any recognition and to get promotion you have to be reporting to an experienced manager in the first place.
Working day and night: it is not just overtimes, it is work on the weekends too.
Keep your passion in check: I have never seen so many people burn out anywhere else.
Do not rely on trust: you can get fired by your manager, just because he or she doesn’t like you."

HR processes are highly wasteful and slow, skilled people are leaving and what left behind are people who have cling on the corporate structure to survive, afraid of disruptive changes.

Lack of openness, information are shared only if they are positive news. Bad press are well hidden and not being publicly addressed until they are overdue. Many of townhalls, meal-with-ceo session are discontinued as leadership unable to receive negative feedbacks. Email announcements are sometimes in full Chinese without consideration for employees of 6 non-chinese-speaking employees.

Lack of sense of ownership, direction of product, tech and even business are often made by Chinese, copied from success of Taobao or Tmall and re-applied to SEA market without proper handover, proper training. This lead to ownership of many of key domains being shifted to teams in Hang Zhou and Shenzhen instead of local team.

Lot of foreigners using Lazada as a spring board to move to other companies in Singapore.

Foreigners rejecting job offers even after being offered 8K per annum and HR pacifying them with more pay while locals are being bargained with their asking pay to settle for lower pay ! This can happen only in Singapore. Pathetic HR and HR is interested in the welfare of Foreigners than Locals.

Locals accept lower pay as any pay is a good pay for them. So advice to locals is to demand higher pay even though HR try to bargain with you. Always note that you are being offered less than foreigners in the first instance."	"Locals are shunned and considered only for low level positions from Analyst to Senior Associate positions. While you see some in mid level positions, will be hard to see in upper level positions from VP to Executive VP, leave alone the C level. 

Max at least smiles whenever he see a Lazadian in office or outside (whatever stress he has been in) while Pierre love to show his poker  face. He may smile if he see a french but definitely not at others :-( 

Sorry Pierre. Thought that you will give some importance for locals as you are 50% local but you still seem to live in your french diaspora which is evident from your recent appointments of heads for LeL.

- Competitor obsessed, always stalking what Shopee is doing

- Forced to use Ali’s tech stack in mandarin with zero effort to localise it. In-house data visualization software is the most rudimentary I have ever seen and extremely painstaking to use. Exporting data is such a hassle given the tight data security thus operations are inefficient

- Majority of business managers do not know basic SQL/Python/R yet they work at a tech firm 

- Some roles are routine and can actually be outsourced to contract staff

- Whole set of C-suite executives for each mini venture/business unit making the entire org chart convoluted"

1285	Senior Associate	 Anonymous Employee	24 Sep 2018	2.0	"Huge industry potential -- E-commerce industry in SEA is a blue sea, and grows rapidly. Lazada is the strongest player in the local market. Therefore if you are interested in the industry, Lazada is a good place to start. 
Fast paced working environment --- It could be very challenging sometimes. but you can learn a lot in a short period of time, and develop your ability faster than in a mature corporate. 
Colleagues are nice --- I feel most of Lazadians ( not those from Alibaba) are respectful and smart. Even though sometimes there are conflicts or argument,  but that's normal. Lazadians always work together to find a solution in a structural way. and they try their best to not hurt others."	"Before Alibaba:
Bad HR management: Career path is very unclear. HR team is not doing anything to help employees to grow. 
Unclear roadmap: seems like we were trying a lot of different things. But the team doesn't have clear visibilities about where we were heading to.

After Alibaba:
Still Bad HR Management -- I don't see any changes expect they keep replacing local employees with Alibaba persons, some of whom cannot even speak English properly.  
Roadmap -- I still don't know. I don't know why I'm working hard for this company. Which direction we are heading to. Why my job is important ( if it is）....... Before Alibaba, with all the cons, I still choose to stay with Lazada. It's because I share the value of the company. I'm not sure if I still share the same value with Alibaba. 
Working Environment: A lot worse. Many people from Alibaba(especially the commercial side) have no idea about what respect is. I can tell Alibaba has no clue about how to run a multinational company. As other comments mentioned, the most frequent words you can hear is :"" in T-mall, we always..."" You can see they are basically copying everything from T-mall, Taobao to Lazada. However,   Lazada is not T-mall or Taobao. The culture is different, the market is different, the suppliers are also different. So stop copying everything, and learn from the locals. And speaking of professionalism, I deeply feel Lazadians are way more professional and efficient than Ali persons. ( SOP and rules sometimes mean nothing to Alibaba persons)"

- Flexibility: Nobody is very clear about what they are doing so, of course, you can do anything. No real goal, no real method to measure the success of a project, no real roadmap, and deadline..."	"- Lazada is considered slow for the e-commerce industry. The speed you see is just the speed of ruining things when employees do not understand what they are doing. Then smarter people have to clean the mess up. This keeps happening so smart people do not have time to build smart things. Then smart people leave (and they should).
- No innovation, creativity is killed here. 
- People are put in the job that they do not have relevant skills or experience -> that rule all the projects they manage and also ruin the team spirit regardless of the level of the ruiner. 
- Alibaba came and made things worse. They have no experience in ruling a multinational company, but they think they do. The communication effectiveness between Alibaba and Lazada is equal 0. Alibaba team also has no sense of cultural difference. 
- Alibaba is changing all the non south-east Asian employees to Alibaba staff. They don't understand that the cultural diversity should be more than just Chinese and other countries but a good mix of people for a good mix of the points of view on anything.
- Communication is too mixed up and people get different information from different channels."

But since the Chinese management has entered the picture, Lazada became a place of horror. These Chinese Leadership/Management thinks that they know everything and that we (old Lazada employees) doesnt know anything. Collaboration is one key for overall success of a team/company, but Chinese team do not think nor show this. They know everything, so why listen to small time old Lazada employees, right? This has made everyone, including myself to feel degraded and of course, it affects the morale of the employees.

Also, Alibaba's goal is towards Globalization, right? Maybe, that is just for a show as it turns out, once we have China teams on top, they do everything in their own language; business, product and tech! It really doesnt add up."

As Lazada aim to be a tech company, a lot of data is available so if you like numbers and transparent results, you can dig out insight for yourself.	"A typical 1-man-show culture with everyone runs at CEO's orders (the Chinese CEO from Alibaba). Since the Alibaba management took over, many ppl have left the company due to ineffective leadership (not sure if it's Alibaba intention to let ppl go by themselves).

Everyone got to install 2 apps (1 for chat and the other for VPN authentification, conference call) which can track your location instantly. The boss can use it to see where you are, if you come to work late, if you are at home or doctor's if you file a sick leave."

Before Alibaba took over, the Lazada senior management was incredibly unprofessional, aggressive, hostile and frankly, just not qualified. It was a nightmare to work at Lazada and do meaningful, proper work but a few championed through despite the numerous issues to try to build up something decent. 

With Alibaba management the hope was that things would become more professional, informed and lift the bar. Sadly things got even worse. People demoted, teams crushed or replaced over night. I say this having personally raised up and discussed these issues collaboratively in 1-1 with all snr management prior and current at CPO, CTO even CEO level. 

No clarity ever offered about future plans, projects and lack of strategy getting even worse (hard to believe). And ofcourse everything became blatently copying Chinese tmall and Alibaba apps. Even much more so than before the takeover. So zero initiatief or intellect needed, just do as you are told and work 24/7. Don't question anything. It is clear that the Chinese way of working means there is no room for intelligent discourse."

They head hunted me from one of the top ecommerce company, bought me to a regional role. I was one man army in my team, my boss was good but lack of proper guidance and his deadlines kept changing under the pressure of top management. In the end I was one to suffer with fast implementation and deadlines. Anyways fast forward, I successfully launched the project, and time I decided to move into a different role.  Also because another team manager  wanted me in thier team to lead aproject. But withing a month, my boss quit, whole org changed. A new boss came.. Who too left and then came Aimone. All this happened in a month. Aimone is the most arrogant, bossy and unprofessional person u will find in Lazada. I wonder if there is any employee From HK who speaks good of him expect his puppets. He without even meeting or talking to anyone of our old team puts us in situation where most of us has to leave the company or fired. He didn't even bother to keep the old team or do call with us. He pre planned a org chart with his old favorites n puppets  replaced the entire old team. He destroyed many of us and our careers. When I spoke to HR about this, they knew it was not ethical but said we are helpless. So no one can save you in this company.

No value for Lazadians - we have to do what ever said by Chinese whether it is correct or wrong. No feedbacks are acceptable for them.
  
Where are we heading - no one knows, may be some 10 Chinese in top level.

No transparecy on salary or promotions - you cannot question on this because there is a prepared answer from HR. “It has been decided by some one beyond them”. However true reason is favorism. I can mention many examples but i dont want go that far. 

Worst HR - few local HR actually good but they have no power to do any thing. Because so called reagional HR from SG. Basically they will bring so many process and structures but will never listen to personalize issues.

High turn over - at least around 400 people had to left this company in last 6 month including Rusian and Thailand tech hub

- Attempts to stabilize employees through townhalls has backfired
- At some companies we talk about perks, but here, there’s hardly anything. Over the past few months, cost cutting has been at unprecedented levels. A coffee machine for commercial and marketing team has been removed, even Yoga and English classes have been cancelled..."

3. Recognizes employees who have loud mouth or from top companies not based on deliverables made
4. There is a huge gap in pay with in same designation in India [50 % above is common ], If you decide to join make sure you negotiate hard
5. Very frequently you will find a  guy who will write a code which has to be re-written in next year because of bad design. He would move to a different team and disown his code.

1345	A sad demise to what was once a great company	 Senior Vice President	12 Jun 2018	1.0	Many pros before Mar 2018, when Alibaba made sweeping changes, firing the old guard who knew what they were doing and had built a legacy around the region, and motivated staff - Max was a great cheerleader and kept the fire burning in our hearts and minds.	"- Since Mar 2018, Alibaba has put Lazada into a freefall - hardly 10 people in the company (mostly Chinese people from Alibaba) and country CEOs are clued in on what changes are happening (Changes happen now every few hours, if not days)
- Zero communication below the 10 people that Ali feels matter in the company (of a size of 7000)
- Management attend useless meetings all the time with no agenda, purpose or outcome
- Peanuts salary increments and bonuses
- No line of sight into what will become of employee options/path to liquidity
- HR is doing an absolutely abyssmal job - the only job seems to be producing pages and pages of org charts which change every day, cutting roles, and focusing on firing 30% of the staff, or engineering their exit (due to staff frustration)"

1348	CEO out, teams disbanded	 Tech Team Lead	11 Jun 2018	1.0	"Lazada used to be a great company to work for: challenging but rewarding. I truly believed in company values and management was very transparent.

Pros of the existing company is that you would work with some great people hired back then. They know, what does it mean to work hard, delivering results but be cautious and not to waste money."	"Since Alibaba took over Lazada and fired CEO (Max, all the best to you), management is being replaced with Chinese nationals in all countries. Basically, Lazada turns into yet another division of Alibaba group being fully managed out of China. This means Alibaba culture, Alibaba business practices, Alibaba everything.

If you are fine with that, there will be no issue for you. If you don’t like the idea of no carrier growth unless you are from Alibaba, then this place is not for you.

Also, offices in Singapore and Jakarta are badly maintained and overcrowded. I do not recommend working there, work conditions are less than ideal."

Restructuring too frequently. Especially the last restructure that had no communication from management whatsoever on what is changed, why it was changed and how to manage the change. Everything feels like top down and last minute decision. Decisions are made by a small Chinese community in a room and when they have decided on something it is published to employees outside. Company right now has no target, no direction, no roadmap. Everyone is just doing their daily job without knowing what is to come."

1358	Glassdoor reviews do not do it justice...it's worse	 Senior Associate	24 May 2018	1.0	some people here are nice but they tend to be quite depressed and look worn out	"The new Alibaba HR people are not very good, it's just more and more pointless late meetings for no reasons and cost control on spending. Maybe in China HR is more old school type because company seems to be going backwards. 

It's a frustrating place to work, the crazy founders are being let go one by one but the new people just don't get our culture. When foreign companies come to Singapore they should adapt to us not us to them. Previous leaders at least tried to 'get' Singapore. 

If you want to work in an eCommerce business go to Shopee, my friend works there and although they have issues it seems better."
1359	Senior Associates	 Senior Associate	16 May 2018	2.0	Lazada impressed me with its fast-paced environment and its amazing new office. I learn a lot throughout these years about e-commerce in general. You will be working with smart professional who share the passion to make the economy works. You will experience multi-cultural working experience. Many people here will welcome you warmly. They know how to work hard and party hard as well.	As a young company, I think Lazada’s management is very immature. So many changes throughout these 2 years of working. There are a lot of major changes (3 times CEO changes, a lot of shipping policy changes, 4 times major organizational structure changes and more minot changes). Moreover, all of these changes a lot of times are to be implemented immediately. As an employee, we have to execute. Many senior management does not take into account limitation in the execution and seems like all decisions are made without careful consideration and planning which in turn cost a lot. Example, the organization structure change in the middle of preparation of big campaign which makes it super hectic and not healthy. Senior management in the local market seems to be hard-headed and does not try to fit with local market culture and characteristics. Regional to local communication is also very bad. Regional tend to be bossy to local market (especially in the business side where local culture matters). The local market CEO is also very hard-headed in these terms and therefore internal communication is super chaotic. Many divisions do not know what to do and what changes are affecting them. As the result, sellers and buyers alike become the victim of these rash decision making, internal communication problem and inconsistent policy. HR is also very bad. Compare to the competitors, the benefit and facility from the company is much worse. No any intention to retain amazing talents in the company. As the result, Lazada’s organization is too small for its scale and make its employee go crazy.

1364	Great place to learn. Terrible place to earn.	 Manager	9 May 2018	2.0	A lot of learning opportunities, a lot of exposure, and will teach you to manage stress well.	"Pays peanuts: Lazada pays at 50% of market value. 
Terrible work schedule and culture: Management has no regard for employees' personal life and preferences.
Transitioning into a hierarchical company: A lot has changed in the past 6 months, and there is a lot of hierarchy, and discrimination. The pros mentioned above are going away very quickly. 

I wouldn't consider Lazada as a long term career choice. Learn as much as you can quickly, and look for opportunities that pay better (there are plenty)."
1365	Avoid at all cost	 Senior Manager	2 May 2018	1.0	To get a shiny brand name on your CV	"First time in 10 years + career that I found myself working for such a mismanaged, inefficient and corrosive organisation. 

If you are a well-balanced, decent individual and believe in professional values such as: integrity, meritocracy, vision, transparency, then stay away from this organisation.
Lazada is basically a poorly managed Alibaba wannabe that lacks vision and strategy and the talent and structure to roll it out if they had it.

The top Management team is now made up on the one hand of the initial ""boys club"", and of a few Alibaba executive who were parachuted in Singapore, on the other. 

Needless to say, this unlikely cocktail is creating an ever changing, unsecure environment where priorities are constantly re-assessed.

Just trying to be objective and factual here, so here's a quick list of what's wrong with the organisation and will impact you in you daily job:

1. Lack of vision -apart from trying to tear appart competition.

2. Lack of transparency -you will only learn about a ""new"" strategy or project on the day it is launched or after! IF you are lucky enough to be told! 

3. Lack of communication -only type of communication I had with management (including direct line of reporting) was retro-active or micro-managing every detail from a powerpoint presentation for example. 

4. Lack of talent -Lazada primarily rewards and promotes people who are skilled in office politics and good at selling themselves and their mediocre achievements

5. Unfair -if someone at the tops decides that he/she doesn't like you, then there's virtually no barrier preventing that person from making your life a nightmare

6. No respect for people some behavior would probably considered abusive in other companies. It seems that treating people like slaves is the only way to make oneself respected here."

- Good for learning about e-commerce (in Thailand)
- Low barrier between employee and management team 
- Very short planning: see result from your actions fast to keep on developing
- Still have the start-up environment where your ideas are actually  implemented
- Free dinner
- Salary is rather high for new grads"	"- No structure of work. Everything is messy
- No work-life balance at all (email at 8pm Friday night for deadline EOD on Saturday is regular)
- Politic. If you are happen to be a sibling of the management team, you're likely to be able to do everything , get everything , moved to anywhere and even skip work tasks that everyone has to do and get promoted
- Need strong survival skill. No mentor. Everything you have to learn by yourself and no one really knows things to teach. 
- Bonus and commission are something that always in blur line. Even the sales value which used to calculate commission can decrease by 40% on the pay day out of the blue.
- (For Key Account Manager) Difficult to reimburse phone bill like you are encouraged to just pay by yourself
- If you are Thai, very hard to be in management level. Promotion is not very transparent. 
-  It's always the Italian or French team to be in any lead whom some of them don't have knowledge about Thai market, trend, culture, and customers. And since e-commerce in Thailand is just 5 years ish, people in the company are either know only Lazada stuff (e-commerce) and nothing else about commercial or strong in the commercial (from other company) but no e-commerce experience
- Over value people that have experience in consultant firms even working there less than a year, no other experience, and have zero knowledge about market and commercial sales"

2) No more good work. Under the name of DATA ENGINEERING people are just writing SQL. There is nothing to learn over here.

The colleagues are generally friendly and supportive although there are a bunch of morons in senior levels of management who think o end of themselves and often call themselves the old Lazadaians, the tier 2 founders, etc.,  The CEO had a vision but his lieutenants failed to execute on his mission (except for the one who manages brands/ online stores) used fear mongering and lacked strategic thinking, did not like to hear another point of view and only want ass-kissers. Horizontal orgs generally surround themselves with yes-men and yes-women. If you're not ""one of them"" you were not in the inner circle and won't even get invited to meetings you should be a part of.  The culture is generally a lot of yelling and screaming and lack of clarity in  objecives.  Many senior CxOs like to bully (the ex CIO is an exception and well mannered). Some of the CxOs like to throw their weight around and expect you to stop your meeting and walk back to the boss's desk to answer a silly question or to have you print something that is not necessarily an urgent item.

Employees who can contribute to the company are not valued - unclear career path, lack of training & development programs, not even basic mentoring by seniors can be seen. Management communications are especially weak and unclear - most things are done and decided 'in secret' by senior management without communicating to lower level staff who are extremely frustrated by all the changes, no efforts are made to retain leaving employees who have contributed a lot to the company, high turnover is prevalent. Situation is so bad that people are leaving without even wanting to wait for their bonuses. Lazada culture and way of people management? Simply replacing employees as they go - they are just working machines. All of these mentioned are also so prevalent in the company regional HR department which is deemed as the core support pillar in the region. Just think how can a company actually succeed when even its own HR people are leaving the ship and good ones have already left? This is extremely disheartening and truly turn one heart's cold.

However the other 99% are terrible, with often high IQ's and low EQ's. These are the type of consultants who seem to have never been in contact with other human beings before and as a result their team quits or worse stays but become inefficient and demotivated. 

Icing on the cake is that Lazada C-Levels don't really care. Wait no, the real cherry on top is that if you're in management, you can find it very comfortable since you can mess up as much as you want and you won't get reprimanded."

Colleagues are generally highly motivated and are also very good to get along with. A youthful environment ensures that almost every day at the office is lively.	There is a culture issue, with much of management inexperienced in managing and subsequently poor at time and resource allocation.

Would recommend only if you do not mind the poor remuneration that comes with the heavy workload

2. A good platform to exhibit your hidden talents especially if you are a high achiever. However, You have to be a loud person as well."	"1. Poor working culture. It is expected of you to work long hours without the due compensation. Clocking in more work hours without necessarily being more efficient = perceived to be more hardworking

2. They have a strong preference for hiring expats at the C level, mostly hired without any ecommerce experience. Might be due to the fact they can clock in working hours without any leadership skills to lead the team to the next level. You are expected to tread in the water yourself and at the best time be an adviser to the same group of people while getting low or below market average pay.

3. No retention strategies. Not surprising since the turnover rate for HR is also relatively high.

Management team (specially top level) are highly skilled, experienced professionals; mistakes are always tolerated unless there's really something wrong with you. I don't say it's the best place to work but definitely it's a rare experience. Salaries are fine (not high but not unfair). I gave it 5 star because for me pros weigh way more than the cons.

I don't know why the company is so proud of having 4000+ workers with this size. Maybe labour is too cheap in this region that they don't mind creating more and more manual processes, instead of hiring a few smart guys to create smarter process. 
Management doesn't care about your growth. People are leaving every single day. There is no sense of belongingness at all. If somebody do an unofficial poll, I wouldn't be surprised if more than 50% is thinking about quitting this company.

1618	Great school for young talented people	 Anonymous Employee	9 Oct 2015	4.0	Lazada is a place for great talents thirsty to learn and develop themselves. I have seen people progressing at an incredible speed and getting exposed to various parts of the business. It is also an environment where it matters little how old or experienced you are. If you are good and prove yourself, you can get rewarded quickly. You also have the freedom to try a lot of things on your own.	While I can say that the majority of the people are very hard working, there are also some (including the senior management) who seem completely misplaced. It is demotivating to see such people tolerated despite contributing close to nothing.

The company will work you to the bone and as soon as you show any sign of falling below 120% for a second you will be seen as a weakness with a view for you to leave.This business mentality is a ruthless one so make sure you get the appropriate compensation should you want to work for them.

I think this will change in 1 to 2yrs once the rocket internet culture and hitmen squad have washed away while Lazada brings in its own identity. Until then I'd stay clear."

1622	Great potential for bigger things!	 Anonymous Employee	1 Oct 2015	4.0	A leader in the e-commerce space. Given its short 3 year history, Lazada has impressed with its dominance of the e-commerce industry in SEAsia. I have recently seen new, experienced senior leaders recruited into the team and there apparently is a greater emphasis on Finance, HR, ER and Corporate Governance. There is a sense that the company is shaping up and moving in the right direction. I must say that communication has improved with an increase in the no. of updates from Group CEO as well as the frequency of Townhall mtgs. More development in terms of training and talent mobility. With the recent support of the Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign, it looks like there is a stronger emphasis on CSR initiatives. Great start and looking forward to greater progress in 2016.

Resources are provided to succeed.	The company is overworking its people and pressure to deliver is high. When employees are showing signs of slowing down the solution is too often to simply replace them, which impedes on the trust that employees have in the company. It is difficult to imagine a long term career at Lazada.

Having been brought in to help make Lazada´s own private label  the ""next best thing"" and make them a substantial fashion brand in SEA. I was promised travel, benefits, joining fashion fairs and so on. But, alas, when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. 

-The CEO and management were all Caucasian, shouty, arrogant wankers in bright colored shirts or chinos, with lots of money and no respect for anyone that wasn't Caucasian (little advice, if you have a company in Asia, at least give some higher postions to some locals).
-The ""travel benefits"" were shocking, 30SGD a day for food and drink, which if you know how much money that is, you know its not sufficient enough. We were promised time and time again that this amount would be increased, which it obviously wasn't.
-No cohesiveness between the management and their employees, we were promised that the management were fully behind the fashion team, and that there was no way at all that we should worry for our jobs, and then we were all fired.
-The CEO used to go around shouting and swearing at the top of his voice on his mobile. I'm not fully convinced that he was on his phone, I think that he just did it to intimidate people (which he didn't)."

1646	Prejudiced hiring & promoting practice; think carefully what you want out of the experience	 Anonymous Employee	9 Jun 2015	2.0	Pioneering e-commerce in Southeast Asia and company raised enough funds to spend/splash around	Hiring and promoting is very prejudiced and biased towards Europeans from certain background (consulting/banking) and schools. It is very evident that pretty much all the 'management staff' are European/Caucasian, although they are running a business in Southeast Asia. While this practice is somewhat common at Multinationals in the region, this level of stratification and prejudice is unheard of in other similar companies (e.g. think Google, Facebook, or even in Banking or Consulting firms based in the region). The salaries, benefits, career advancement opportunities are different if you are local vs. 'European management.' The management 'move around' to get 'exposures' and vying for the 'next top job' while local staff who quickly realize that there's no long-term advancement here quit after coming to get what they are looking for (e.g. certain experience, building CV etc.). The company is focused on getting the 'next round of funding' fast vs. really building a business for the long-term -- I mean, how many Europeans can  the company import to run the businesses -- and many of them don't speak the language, can't talk to vendor, don't even understand what's on the site, etc. The management generally don't care about building team but getting their own personal advancement (title, team size, fiefdom).

1658	Big emerging online marketing within South East Asia region. They are similar to Amazon. More than 1000 employees	 Account Manager	11 Mar 2015	4.0	Good salary, no fixed schedule and friendly environment. Suitable for new graduates and people who can work in dynamic environment.	Good salary but you have to work hard. The office is not well organised. You have no own partition. You have to sit altogether with other employees in the office.
1659	Fast paced, intense, steep learning curve, as well as super talented and bright people. Great experience so far.	 Category Management	11 Mar 2015	4.0	Growth, autonomy of role, exposure to different functions and general drive of the people who work here. Compensation is good, flexible working hours, international and diverse crowd. Lots of opportunities to move around.	Pace is fast so communication isn't always there. Compensation still a bit basic in structure. Results driven so you need to on top of your game. A few more perks here and there would be good. Hours can be unpredictable. More formal training would be helpful.
1660	A good challenge	 	11 Mar 2015	4.0	Great place to learn with the company as it grows, and many opportunities to work with everyone across the board. Everyone's very driven and focused, and it is the kind of environment that motivates me.	Would be great if employees could get more staff benefits. Everyone works really hard at Lazada (and plays hard too!).
1661	Not for the faint hearted.....	 Anonymous Employee	11 Mar 2015	4.0	The company is growing crazily fast and plans are aggressive. It has certainly been an interesting ride that even my own role and responsibility and expanded over the last 3 months.  This is probably a company that you will do 3 years of work in 1, definitely exciting if you are a 'do-er' but certainly not for the faint hearted!  Have seen people who have rotated through different jobs which shows good opportunity and hopefully I can get my chance too.	"Work-life balance is not great due to the speed of Change. 
Benefits wise may not be holistic but have certainly noted improvements since last year and hope that it will improve further!"
1662	Analyst	 Anonymous Employee	4 Mar 2015	1.0	"Challenging work experience
Good team support
Nice view over the city"	"Horrible horrible salary range
Absolutely no respect to employee what so ever
No Transparency in HR Policy.
They won't look for long term commitment with you."
1663	Worst Company to work for, worst time	 Anonymous Employee	2 Mar 2015	1.0	Good salary package, standard benefit	"- Low morale working environment due to high turnover
- Harsh and political working environment"
1664	Challenging!	 	12 Feb 2015	4.0	This company is undergoing many exciting changes and there are always many opportunities to look forward to. Even if you are not intending to continue in your current field, the company encourages you to rotate around departments. The work itself is fulfilling and encourages you to work beyond your expectations.	Benefits are still lacking for the moment and there should be more opportunities and resources available for talent development in my opinion. It can also be stressful at times.
1665	Lazada is a good place to work as a young and enthusiastic professional	 Logistics Development Manager	10 Feb 2015	4.0	"Young, dynamic working environment.
Learn very fast if you are smart and have the data analysis sense.
Good earning in general"	"Company don't repsect the longterm relationship.
Fast moving, fast firing.
Face with huge amount of work and the feeling of unjust between people in the company"
1666	"I will proudly say ""I was there"""	 Anonymous Employee	4 Feb 2015	4.0	"This company is growing fast. I mean really fast!
It give a bunch of experience, carrier opportunities and freedom that mature companies cannot give.
It is very attractive to less experience people, but experienced ones can also find a second breath and challenges to continue learning and growing (my case - 9yrs of experience).
Once approved the timeline between a good idea and it's application is a matter of weeks, days or, even sometimes, hours. And approving (or rejection) doesn't take long...
Very little time is spent on ""noneffective work"" and it is possible to quickly see the results of the work.

The future looks bright and it is great to picture ourselves in few years time saying ""I was there""."	"Constant environment evolution can be both exciting and challenging.
The fast growing pace means that sometimes the job/scope can grow faster than the person and a period of hard work is expected to adjust.
It sometimes can be overwhelming but additional skills learned is also a reward."
1667	Rotten culture & leadership	 Anonymous Employee	22 Nov 2014	1.0	Pay is OK if you're white or if they're scared to lose you. By now nobody cares enough anymore, so you actually get to go home at a decent hour. You might learn something - mostly how not to manage a company and treat people.	"Culture is totally rotten, starting from the very top. Lots of shouting, insults, personal attacks. Tons of nepotism and favoritism based on family and investor connections. Racial and socioeconomic profiling during the hiring process. Locals max out at the VP level and top management doesn't think they deserve any better, even if performance is top notch. Politics and power games are key factors in all decision-making. People are hired without a need, solely to give extra leverage to their managers (""empire building""). Regional structures are implemented to take power away from local management. Those who stay are usually yes-men or have learned to imitate the ""leadership"" style at the top. No real dissent is allowed and people who speak their mind are pushed out swiftly. Many others leave on their own. Turnover is huge. New ""managers"" are sent in every few months. Most employees are frustrated and leave with the first decent offer they receive. 

Do yourself a favor and stay away!"
1668	It's just wrong place to work	 Anonymous Employee	19 Sep 2014	1.0	People are the best things here, very talented individuals - you will be enjoy working with the local team here.	"1) The seats are bad, you will be working on picnic tables.
2) No benefits
3) Very messy - the ratio is 5:1, 5 being people that saying what need to be done and 1 being the person that is actually doing all the requests for those 5"
1669	It's a living	 Writer	25 Jul 2014	2.0	It's fun getting to work with their different products, they have first Friday parties in the office, HR is very helpful.	No clear structure when I left, crazy overtime.
1670	Fast paced culture	 Key Account Manager	18 Jul 2014	3.0	Learn alot and then the learning curve stops	bad pay. the inner circle gang always find you expendable
1671	"""In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity"" - Sun Tzu"	 Anonymous Employee	11 Jun 2014	4.0	"Great place for someone who thrives on chaos and sees it as an opportunity to create something out of nothing.

The fast-paced life is highly rewarding for someone who loves being in a dynamic, fast-paced environment.

Friends are made quickly due to the nature of the business and daily interactions."	"The hours can sometimes be long and taxing, even though it doesn't happen very frequently.
Benefits are OK,  after all this is a start-up environment. 

Lack of open communication at times, and tension among legacy players and newbies - but this is moving in the right direction that is more communication and transparency which allows all parties to fully understand each other.

People who join Lazada should be here for the ride and the exposure to grow and relish the opportunity to be an entrepreneur without having to fork out a hefty investment."
1672	Life Changing	 Head of Search and Display	12 May 2014	1.0	"- Developed strong analytical skills
- Gained a better understanding of the banking world
- Received Health Insurance"	"Poor working benefits such as;
- No work permit
- Low salary
- Ridiculously long and unhealthy working hours
- Company claimed they paid my taxes, never provided any proof, so I assume it was stolen
- Treated with no respect
- The way you removed all of us from the company has substantially affected my career"
1673	Great Organization but VERY VERY messy	 Recruitment	5 May 2014	2.0	You get to learn a lot - Co- workers are passionate about their job.	No matter how hard you work - no appreciation is shown - Title plays a big role in this Organization. No respect shown.
1674	Terrible management, horrible working hours, no appreciation of employees.	 Manager	28 Apr 2014	2.0	Good colleagues. Getting to know people you work with is easy as everyone is a friend rather than just a colleague.	Working hours are horrible, 9am-6pm but you are expected to stay longer. If you come in a few minutes later than 9am, you get a warning letter but no give and take for the fact that you stay till 10pm or later. Management does not care about employee welfare, no benefits, no over time, you work continuously even on weekends, sick days and annual leave. No work-life balance. It feels more like an army camp than a work place. A place where management are bosses rather than leaders. Employee turnover rate is very high, many leave and are replaced with basically anyone who has an education. No real filtering in employment.
1675	Pleasant	 Anonymous Employee	9 Apr 2014	3.0	"- friendly and approachable employees

1677	Bad company culture; hopeless management with no skill & respect; sucks!	 Manager	15 Feb 2014	1.0	They pay okay. You must ask good pay here to compensate yourself with a stress environment.	"Bad working culture, no career advancement, bad reputation in industry. 

This company culture sucks. The working environment is unsatisfied and you will not have a future in the company. Never hire a lazadians that were with the company for more than 1 year. You will regret! Those good hire will left the company within 6 months as the longer you stay the faster you will be destroyed by their culture. Ask around the industry or any ex Lazadians who were with the company less than 6 months. 

The old staff is playing office politics and forming small circle in the company which they will reject any new hire and interns at their very best. If you want to join their circle; you have to join them in talking bad things about management or whoever they complained about. They are also good at faking in front of anybody. Office politics is normal for them as they are just a group of unskillful employee looking to protect their job. 

Their management didn't have proper planning or long plan for the company. You won't be surprise if their plan is only 1 day old and it can get cancelled anytime. They just simply hire anybody who has no skills at all because hiring somebody no smarter than themself is a great way to protect their job. You won't be surprise at all if there is director, regional, manager, specialist or executive who has no idea about their job requirement or without any skills.

HR is none the less the worst department which has no respect to other employee. Don't expect HR to help you and they have no system or no proper rules in there. They are just a group of employee that is proud and thinking that they are god who gave you a job. If you want a respect of your talent; never join Lazada Malaysia.

They are hiring people as a worker instead of looking to build a great team. If you are looking for a career, please don't join this company. There is no training in the company and career advancement is none. They will give you fancy title but you are none the less just another worker in the company. You cannot imagine the number of VP or Manager Director or Head or Manager they have in a company. LoL."
1678	Fast growing, Big Challenges!	 Anonymous Employee	31 Jul 2013	4.0	It's good company for young professionals who want to explore the start-up experiences. You will work in multi-nationalities employee. It's fun for those who are workaholic and proactive.	You life is your work. You hardly have no time after work with friends outside office. High turnover rate. The direction is unclear.
1679	Probably the worst place to work for	 Managing Director	26 Jun 2013	1.0	They apologise for very mistake. Good for individuals who like working in a disorganised environment	"Highly unprofessional even at the senior level 
Uncommitted to their promise
Disorganised and un respectful of time
In all honesty, a very poor work culture"
1680	Social and fun working environment	 Internship	27 Dec 2012	4.0	The employees are friendly, we often have parties, trips or small talk with each other. The CSR of Lazada is pretty good, you can join in many activites	The salary is bad, at the beginning they treat us not bad, then the company want to cut down the number of labour so they easily got us fired.
