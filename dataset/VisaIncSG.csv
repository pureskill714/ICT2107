	Summary	Job Title	Date	Overall Rating	Pros	Cons
0	Great place to intern	 Software Engineer Intern	13 Mar 2023	5.0	Learning culture is great with very knowledgeable and helpful managers	Development maybe abit slow compared to a startup
1	Great WLB	 Software Engineer	13 Mar 2023	5.0	- Amazing WLB - Great culture	- Things can be slow
2	Review for System Analyst Trainee	 System Analyst Trainee	12 Mar 2023	4.0	Good place to learn. People are willing to teach	Very low pay and low chances of conversion
3	Great team culture	 Senior Consultant Software Engineer	10 Mar 2023	5.0	Great team culture - teamwork and great collaboration. Women inclusion in the team. Promotes career progression	Race diversity can be improved
4	Compensation	 Software Engineer	26 Feb 2023	3.0	Good team and work life balance	Less competitive as compared to others
5	Best Culture	 Software Test Engineer	23 Feb 2023	4.0	Good reputation, best working culture, great colleagues, decent benefits, flexible and work/life balance.	"Depending on the team/department you are in, you might be micromanaged or given mundane tasks and it makes it boring. Sometimes feels like there are too many ""middle managers"" that don't do much except for attend meetings yet the juniors have the bear most of the work. Oh and they love contractors more than full time staff. Too many of them makes the team feel out of place as some are working remotely and there is no sense of belonging. Hot desk system not the best and hybrid model should stick to 2 not 3 days in the office."
6	Awesome culture	 Vice President	22 Feb 2023	5.0	People are truly valued, huge focus on collaborative approach to work, lots of opportunities to move internally	Lacks a performance based culture, can be slow moving
7	Work life balance	 Contractor	21 Feb 2023	5.0	Work-life balance, helpful colleagues, supportive management	none as of now... everything looks so good at Visa
8	overall good place to work	 Senior Data Scientist	18 Feb 2023	4.0	good work and life balance, flexible	too much internal politics, have to build relationships
9	Decent place but a lot of org changes and bureaucracy	 Manager	9 Feb 2023	4.0	Good benefits Good salary Generally nice people	Too much unnecessary collaboration Slow processes Bad go to market for new products
10	Nice	 Software Engineer	3 Feb 2023	4.0	Really friendly bosses and colleagues	Abit on the slow side in terms of work
11	A good working place in overall	 Software Test Engineer/QA Engineer	2 Feb 2023	5.0	- Provides with a good working culture (US based) - Flexibility on working hours (offer hybrid model, possibilities on working from home) - Proper annual evaluation systems ( clear goal and objectives) - Provided with highly competitive packages with lot benefits (Flex benefits, health insurances etc.)	- In some cases a bit of impractical work goals - High workload
12	Great	 Technical Writer	1 Feb 2023	4.0	Career growth, employee benefits, work life balance	Bureaucracy, high pressure, travel globally
13	Solid Company, Good benefits	 Sr Director, Technology	21 Jan 2023	4.0	Comprehensive benefits and a flexible work/life balance	'Too many chefs in the kitchen' - this is not a nimble startup.
14	Positive Outlook	 Senior Data Engineer	16 Jan 2023	5.0	Very good team with drive and passion Flexible people and helpful managers Good WORK-LIFE Balance	I don't have any cons on employee benefits, It's excellent for permanent employees but not for contractors
15	Stable, Big, Busy	 Staff Software Engineer	22 Dec 2022	2.0	"- Good & smart colleagues mostly 
- Good benefit 
- More or less stable company compared to other tech peers, although you still have the small chance of lay-off 
- It is good for your career if you don't mind sacrificing your personal time"	"- Poor work life balance- long hours & weekends: you sometimes have to work on weekends FULL DAY in some teams. Some big bosses also tend to romanticize working weekends. It also depends on team though. So, if you are lucky, you might land in a team with good work life balance 

- You are required to be on-call (24 hour standby) during peak periods even though you are L3 support! Again, some teams don't require that

- Some coworkers like to text the team during personal hours such as late night, weekends, etc... on WhatsApp. There seems to be a culture where you have to show you are hard-working to get that promotion! 

- Corporate wants to bring employees back to office 100% 

- Process heavy, old tech, you will get tied to very niche project with small scope and do the same thing throughout, while your knowledge getting outdated"
16	Review	 Software Engineer Intern	8 Dec 2022	5.0	Visa is a stable company and a good place if you are seeking that	Slow work environment and not the best engineering culture
17	Best Company in Payment Industry	 Senior Consultant	4 Dec 2022	5.0	ALL their benefits Latest technology stack	Nothing I can think of compared to other peers
18	Good	 Trainee	18 Nov 2022	5.0	Nice people Good training program Good opprtunities	Not much cons at the moment.
19	Rigid, Dinosaur processes. Brands themselves as a Tech company, but acts more like a bank.	 People Team	3 Nov 2022	1.0	People are generally nice on the surface level. Decent internal mobility opportunities.	Very top down driven. Elitist mindset found in most senior management and they really like to gossip. Old school legacies and don't like to innovate. Traditional and work is NOT flexible even if they say it is .Facetime is crucial during meetings / the day and you have to be at your desk. Change management is terrible, managers don't handle it well. they really squeeze you dry, and leave you to drown, then penalize you for it during performance reviews. Lots of people gossip and bootlick as well, this bit i found surprising as I had initially heard great things about Visa's culture so quite disappointed.

Good work life balance."	Nothing nothing nothing nothing .........
24	Good culture	 Trainee	21 Sep 2022	5.0	Good culture, learning is encouraged, opinions are valued	pay not as competitive ..
25	One of the best companies in terms of corporate culture, especially for full time employees	 Software Engineer	20 Sep 2022	4.0	"Visa as an organisation places high emphasis on ethics which makes it an organization that employees can feel proud about working under. It offers benefits to the employees such as 20 hours of paid time off to volunteer, employee donation matching as well as 1 month of childcare leave. 

Visa strives to integrate work life harmony into its work culture and offers employees mental health and well being resources. Employees are also allowed to take Friday afternoons off if they have completed their tasks, during certain times of the year.

As the Return To Office initiative started once the COVID restrictions were lifted, the company staff organized more sessions in the office for employee engagement. Some of these include a Yoga session and a Bollywood jam session.

Hence, if you are looking to join a large company for the long run, then Visa is definitely one of the companies that you should look out for."	"These are applicable to contractors rather than to full time employees:
1. Contractors are not kept in the loop for some of the internal communications that full time employees are involved in
2. Contractors have to get additional permissions to access certain resources 

However, I think that these issues will be faced by contractors at other companies as well so that should not be a problem for those who go into the company knowing about them."

29	Visa needs tech. managers than people managers.	 	30 Aug 2022	3.0	"Good work life balance.
Good benefits."	"The company needs technical managers rather than just people managers when they are transitioning towards innovation and new ideas.
Insecure middle management does not allow technical members to grow or work in desired way.
People in the management take technical decisions without consulting technology staff which later proves disastrous.
Favoritism is a weakness for people in management for  which the company as a whole suffers."
30	Great Place to Work	 Senior Software Engineer	29 Aug 2022	4.0	It's honestly a great place to work with good benefits and a true care for its employees	Tech stacks are a bit dated, with an inertia to move towards newer ones. Business processes are cumbersome but expected with a company that needs to be very concerned about security. All in all not too bad honestly, just wish that pay were a little higher
31	Visa	 Software Engineer	10 Aug 2022	5.0	"Good work life balance

Good Learning Culture
Managers are encouraged to be empathetic and understanding"	"Falling way behind in compensation in Singapore (and many other countries to be honest). HR and management is adamant that they are paying a competitive compensation.

There are also many double standards. In the year where employees got a pay freeze, senior execs continue to have their double digit percentage increment. This is an irony because one of Visa's leadership principle is ""Leading by Example"".

There is many opportunities to achieve great things in Visa as there are many talented engineers if Visa makes an effort to retain them. On the other hand, Visa has to be more firm to remove engineers who have proven to be not up to standards."

67	Slower in implementation, forgets experienced	 Senior Consultant	2 Dec 2021	3.0	The job is challenging definitely, shifting strategies to latest technologies and pay is moderate	"- Too much of process to get your work done
- New College Grads are more paid than the experienced people, not the same importance given to retain existing employees
- Sudden changes / additions in role hierarchy without any discussion with employees"
68	Great experience working at Visa	 Anonymous Employee	25 Nov 2021	5.0	"Open culture
Autonomy to run projects, ideas"	Internal mobility is not as easy as is portrayed

Good learning opportunity to improve skills and can suggest ideas, improvements, do innovations. Good work life balance and year end bonus etc.	Get the right salary while entering in to the company. Specially if you are hired from other countries than the designated work location, you will be paid 50% less when compared to the market and even you will be given less role/designation. So do ground work and know where you stand and demand the package accordingly because getting decent hike here is like seeing shooting star.

Some parts of the technical documentation do not contain enough relevant information.

The employer values your family life and diversity & Inclusion. They are also supportive for your career development including relocation and shifting functions. Generous benefit plans including competitive salary.	I cannot think of any.
89	Visa	 Business Associate	1 Aug 2021	4.0	Visa has pretty good work life balance, benefits are also great.

Not enough flexibility to try new things or change teams."

106	Company has a great culture with focus on employee well-being but some of the employees are ignored	 Director	13 May 2021	3.0	"Overall good working environment and senior leadership team do care about the employees and their well-being
Company strategy is also in-line with what is required in the market to grow"	"Unfortunately people like us who are working in the company for a long time do not get attention. Salary is competitive for persons recruited from outside yet strangely enough we (the long-timers in the company)do not get at par with the standard. I have been promoted to the role of Director long time back yet no adjustment has been made to the salary that should be the standard norm for a promotion. It is quite long that I am underpaid and only few minor adjustments have been done and that is way below the current standard of salary. Being a single earner in the family it really hurts. Moreover, in recent years the annual stock option has also been limited to few and as a result some of us getting ignored without any explanation.
There are also very limited opportunities for career growth path for people like us working in Technology division who are located outside of US. Nobody even bothers about it.
I really feel sad for my team for whom nothing much can be done working in a offsite location. Sometimes all I hear from the other side is what my team has done wrong and what they are lacking even though there are enough evidences of them going above and beyond regularly, working late in the night to deliver projects taking great amount of responsibilities"
107	Great Company, Weakened by Inefficient Highly Political Middle Management	 Engineering	7 May 2021	3.0	"Good CEO - Charismatic, Caring, Delivering in business
Great management of COVID situation, right messaging from CEO to support the employees (although issues in SG in helping employees)
Invest in Learning resources, a good place to do many courses free :)
Good facilities, games, rest place, gym
Nice office, comfortable cozy
Reasonable salary
Growing business, stability, Rich money
Many good people to talk"	"Leadership - All praise to CEO for many good, but he is missing on improving leaders completely. Many old school middle managers, focused on saving their fort and power. Lack of growth mindset to produce great products, lacking leadership and people skills. This is resulting in mediocre and very very political culture. 

Technologies - Sucks at this. Many years behind tech companies. Result of previous point. Engineering practices are from old time. Not learning after a point.

Hr - Does it exist? Lacking skills of tech companies. No focus on culture development. 

Overall a high potential company, but like a old era white elephant with tired and very political system. Not a place to grow as developer. No focus on great product development. Many startups with 50 people building better products."

110	Overall it is a great company to be in	 Senior Software Engineer	27 Apr 2021	4.0	Great environment and work life balance	I have had the opportunity to work in two different team and have a few changes in terms of management/leadership. You can tell if your managers are genuine or not. If you did not get a good manager, just bear with it or move to another team!
111	Good place to work, high pressure, low diversity	 Analyst	27 Apr 2021	4.0	Great place to work and learn	Low diversity, High pressure job, boss was not very open minded
112	Company that believes in wellness	 Event Planner	26 Apr 2021	4.0	Great perks and incentives. CEO has great vision and is a people manager	Too trusting and dependent on line managers.

115	Great	 Senior Help Desk Specialist	16 Apr 2021	5.0	Work environment and people are great.	Unfortunately too much power is given to undeserving managers and salaries could be slightly higher.

119	Needs empathy	 Staff Software Engineer	8 Apr 2021	1.0	"Excellent set of people.
The work is great."	"(Singapore)No empathy towards employees to help them during difficult times like COVID. Literally the condition in the company is either you choose work or family. There is no support to get the employees who are stuck outside. While other companies are doing their best in Singapore to help retain their employees and help them balance the personal and professional life in all ways, Visa seem to have turned their back on employee problems during this covid. 
They have basically left no choice to their foreign employees but to leave and permanently go back to the place where they come from.

The HR policies are too stubborn and they are just adding to the difficulties during such times because of their stubborness to change. The immigration partner firm is doung a miserable job here in Singapore to help the stranded employees get back and on top of that they are charging a hefty amount for service which is absolutely free. It has been 1 n half year into pandemic and it may be around for ling and if this is the support that the foreign employees get at this time, I think it is time to rethink about the relationship with Visa"

It's a financial company pretending to be tech company.
Company is very distracted by all the chaos at home (US), neglecting all other employees at hub sites who want to excel.
AP HR is utterly useless, just a glorified mouth piece for the so called 'Global' office.
Pay for performance is just a joke, low performing staff mysteriously gets RSU without a reason, while high performers were left in ditch. Direct manager has no say at all."

- The AP hub product team in Singapore went from a decent place to work to an absolute disaster in a couple of years
- Bad hires were never addressed - poor behavior and poor performance from managers was left unaddressed and the best people left
- Technology team is full of people who consider success to be having the most headcount, regardless of business outcome
- No documentation of processes or tools, company was in the process of locking down the one wiki we had so it wouldn't be possible to share information across areas

They are working hard at the top level to be in the competitive market and continuously working to work on some cool products based on changing consumer market."	"Management level politics. Especially with Indian managers at the top position. The positions are filled with preferential candidate even before they are open to other internal candidates/ general public  for a competition.

If the funds allocated to to each team could be used in a better way would be more benifitial.

Its difficult to get to next level, as there goes a lot of politics and favouritism behind promotions as well and even though the company has a good policy to support internal mobility, the hiring managers know how to exploit that option and in the end it turns out to be a tool exploited by hiring manager to get someone they like."
199	Sr. Analyst	 Senior Business Analyst	21 Jan 2020	5.0	Visa provides you with international business experience regardless of the team you work for. It's a very open company culture with an increased focus on eliminating silos across business functions.	At a large company, you're bound to encounter some silos. However, it's only top of mind for me because Visa management so openly discusses changing that.

214	Best Intern Experience	 Anonymous Intern	21 Sep 2019	5.0	People here are open minded and friendly. All my coworkers are helpful in helping me with tasks or in areas I had little to no knowledge in. They treat me more than an intern and always invited me to sit in for high-level meetings which sometimes I feel a little out of place but I really appreciate it.	My not-so-good experience came from certain individuals which doesn't really matter. Also, I was unable to extend my internship from 6 months to 9 months because of some 'policy' which I believe it's just from the HR side. Intern pay is lower than the other companies I have interview for too.

Making efforts to tap into non traditional segments within payments."	D&I is about events, PR, photos , linkedin posts and publicity. They do a great job packaging and telling people what to do. Fabulous way of integrating folks into the company! Inauthentic leadership and top management. Agree with a bunch of my fellow colleagues - Australians , Blond/e  rule this place.  If you don't match these categories Mastercard may be a good bet. Current HR team cannot be trusted - one of the worst and most political functions within Visa.

- Diversity on board (mostly U.S.-Centric, which shows in how our competitors are out-pacing us around the world) 
- Though well-intended, would benefit from a President with more technology and international experience ... need more bold thinking and focus
- Huge disparity between how titles are awarded in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world. There are Vice Presidents and Senior Directors working on presentations and operational issues in SF versus Directors charged with P&L for business units across an entire sub-region. Would benefit from FEWER title levels at mid to senior management  thus allowing for mobility through payscale (e.g. Manager, Director, VP, EVP - done)"

235	A giant with very old mineset	 Senior S/W Engineer	15 Oct 2018	2.0	Work-life balance and benefits are good.	Not inclusive as they claim to be. Bias and politics.

- Employees do not leave (most of the managers have been here over 10 years and don't plan on leaving, ever) 
- Difficult to survive if not involved in office politics
- Overall pool of employees are older generation (no entry-level)
- Resistant to change
- Any complaints or reports are not dealt with properly. Employees are told to voice out their concerns and when they do they are told to keep quiet and 'let things pass without stirring the team'. Saw this happening before I left, feel bad for the team who have to deal with it when everyone already knows."
240	White boys (and girls) club	 Anonymous Employee	21 Jun 2018	2.0	Amazing brand, good employee-focused culture, modernizing (ableist slowly), small enough company to feel that family spirit	"A really white-centric company, especially in AP Hub. 

As others reviews have said, being non-white / westernized immediately discounts your perception as a leader. 

They keep trying to act like diversity is a big focus and avoid the ethnic diversity question by making it all about gender diversity. 

They keep saying they‚Äôre making efforts on ethnic diversity but it‚Äôs nothing really. The latest wave of restructuring has only reinforced the white dominance at every layer of management. 


Guess what, gender diversity is not your biggest problem, ethnic diversity in leadership roles is. And you‚Äôre doing nothing about it.

Virtually al leadership teams in AP hub are mostly white. All ‚Äòworking teams‚Äô as they condescendingly put it are mostly Asian. No space for Asians in
mid management or above. It‚Äôs really sad, like reliving what our ancestors went through during colonial times. 

Do you really expect us to believe that there is no real leadership talent available in all of Asia Pacific minus ANZ (the most populous region on earth), including the thousands of Asians already working at Visa? Are they all missing that special something? 

Or is it more likely that the talent is there, it‚Äôs just that your white bias makes you discount it?"

- chance to work with new technology stack 
- great team culture (depends on team)"	"- since a lot of old employees so they try to create dependency upon themselves and very seldom share there knowledge
- Teams have grown 5-8 folds in last 3 years, so growth opportunities have become limited as they have mentality of promoting people by numbers(max 3 per team etc etc) instead of looking if the people in question are already performing at next level at the work.
- Very slow to accept change
- business driven not technology driven."
243	Great place to work... if you're white	 Anonymous Employee	13 Mar 2018	3.0	"Increasingly hiring better talent, younger people, and starting to modernise
Rare example of genuine cultural transformation towards digital (design thinking, innovation, #getdigital etc.)
Great comp and bonuses
Stock is galloping
Internal mobility"	"1. There's a huge bias (subconscious or concious) that only caucasians can make good leader.

In AP Hub, few locals/Asians make it beyond SD whereas white folks with little industry experience get VP in their early 30s.

Some teams have literally all-white leadership teams with legions of Asians working under them. Ironically this is the ASIA business. When a white leader leave, they hire another (or one of the other white lead takes on the leaving person's territory). 

Sure APLT has a few token locals and Indians but those too are far outnumbered and the heavily westernised types.

Who can you complain about this? Your Aussie recruiter? Or the Aussie HR? Or the same thing up the command chain.

We have gym, classes and various events here.	The culture and structure in Visa is not diversified enough. Employees tend to refer their relatives and friends to the same team.
267	Paradise lost	 Senior Director	8 Feb 2017	3.0	"Visa has a fantastic business model with strong financials. Very few companies of its size can claim to have a 40% margin. It's nearest competitor (MasterCard) is almost a clone and poses no real threat. They are both happy to coexist and protect their margins.

There is awesome potential to grow with a lot of countries rapidly moving to electronic payments. There is a strong brand with established relationships in key high growth markets across the globe.

Most of Visa's growth comes not through its own innovation but by virtue of being in fast growing markets. The boat moves forward thanks to the currents (and not the rowers)."	"It's management and its managers... For a global company, its managers have poor people management skills. Though USA forms an increasingly small portion of revenues, the management is completely US centric and frighteningly myopic about it. The world outside of USA is an afterthought to most leaders.

Most leaders are busy in playing politics and making others look bad. The nature of business is such that most folks don't have the ability to influence profitability. Banks wont change to MasterCard or any other competitor on a whim because of high exit costs. They'd need to reissue new cards and branding, both of which cost money and don't necessarily yield returns. So with very little control over financial outcomes, most people realize that perception is the only battle they can wage. So everyone just manages to afloat playing politics."

There is little room for learning even if you are proactive. While senior management encourages employee to be open and transparent, the message fizzles out in the mid level management.
276	Great Company to Work at - at the right time	 Anonymous Employee	2 May 2016	5.0	Visa is a great company to work at. It is in the process of transformation and has just-in-time taken the right steps towards a positive transformation. While the size and the business volume presents a challenging task to keep everyone happy - the company has tried to evolve and provide enough avenues to progress. I found the review process reasonable and the compensation satisfactory at par with the efforts put. Would definitely look forward to work with the company again.	The company needs to come out of US centric mindset and become truly global in the right sense.
277	Stay away for peace of mind	 Lead Developer	3 Apr 2016	1.0	Enjoy life at visa without work just by licking manager's foot.	Politics and foot licking everywhere from top to bottom because those who are at the higher position went there doing the same. No logic in promotion or salary hike. Because managers don't understand work, how will they appreciate good work? Just make manager happy by giving company to coffee break, lunch break or even toilet break. HR puppet of management.
278	Working with Visa	 Senior Systems Engineer	27 Mar 2016	4.0	Best place to work with awesome work-life balance and benefits. Best of Industry standards.	But More recently the steps taken by higher management is tarnishing the image and reducing the output of individuals....

Salary and benefits are fairly good compared with industry standards.
Work & life balance is good as far as most of the projects you're handling are running smoothly."	"People managers evaluate staffs based on favoritism. Favoritism and internal political relationship matters much more than your performance for external clients. It's very important to make friendly relationship with internal staffs, not to be targeted at any downturn.
Since it's a big organization in Singapore now, so many departments are made to manage small part of business processes (such as implementation, configuration and testing teams exist separately), which bring more internal approval processes and longer lead time."

Good people, but only because of the good salaries and not because the see the future.... Can be much better if the leaders will listen.	The Leadership is short term revenue focused. No investment pool, no tracking of the competition improvements and investment. You may call it denial mode!
283	Strong Brand but that's about it	 Manager	6 Jan 2016	2.0	Strong corporate brand but at this juncture, that's really all there is to the company.	"1. Too much bureaucracy - it is extremely difficult to get a simple thing done due to the many layers of approvals put in place. For e.g. does an engagement of USD 1,000 REALLY need approval from the head of department? Sourcing processes need to be revamped as it makes life a hell for those who are trying to move things at a speedier place. 

2. Trying to brand itself as Employer of Choice but the steps taken towards this goal are moving the company in the opposite direction. 

3. Interns and those hired via the new graduate development program are put on a pedestal and given ALL the  admiration and perks that the experienced hires do not have. What are the rest of us, chopped liver?

4. Open and honest communication is not forthcoming especially when there are major changes to compensation and benefits. The pertinent points are buried under a mountain of non-pertinent information. It's as if the management is afraid of facing the employees and have to resort to such cowardly tactics. 

5. No career progression since there are so may people in middle management (Director level). As a result, a people manager ends up hoarding all the work in order to be in the limelight and only allows her direct reports to pick up the scraps and work on things that do not see the light of day. Which leads me to my next point.. 

6. People managers are NOT equipped with people management skills. Very demotivating for"

I was the intern in the technology development of Visa. The whole program was well designed and organized. The culture there was simply amazing: people were so friendly and nice, team was not demanding, work integrated with life perfectly,  and various employee activities were open for us. They took so much care of interns and gave us lots of opportunities to take the real responsibilities on the projects, chances to meet up the senior managers and boarding members as well as the freedom to showcase and spoke out our own ideas.
Besides the work within the team, all the interns had to finish the case challenge competition together in groups throughout the whole internship period. During it, we were mentored by our buddies and senior advisers and mentors who were really nice, friendly and helpful.
We also had the full access to all the employee's welfare benefits, such as free access to the gyms around the island. Everything was simply great.

The most amazing part was all the Visa interns around the world, nearly 300 people including interns from South America, Asia and Africa, all flied to Visa's headquarter at San Francisco to take part in Visa's global summit event. This is simply the best party at the best age with the best people in my life. I got the chance to meet up with lots awesome young and intelligent  people from different parts of world and hang out together. During the one-week event, we got the chance to talk to Visa's CEO Charles, President, Vice Presidents and the other senior boarding members. They are amazing and the company is amazing too. I never knew that Visa is such a cool company which is preparing to change to industry before I went there.
Can't wait to join Visa after graduation to continue my journey with Visa."	Simply amazing, nothing bad. Honestly, I could not ask for anything else, since they really offered us too much.

289	Sr. Information Security Analyst	 Senior Information Security Analyst	25 Oct 2015	4.0	Great place to sharpen your skills.  Good benefits, great people and good work life balance.  It's a good second home.	Unfortunately, they hired mediocre middle managers that tried to re-invent the wheel. The incompetent ones just copy paste the slides of upper management thinking that their direct reports don't know anything. The ambitious ones were leeches. They'll phase you out if they don't like you regardless of your loyalty and the contributions you have made.  I've seen so many good people who were let go and they were great contributors in the company.  Sucks they were replaced by stupid people.
290	Unusual workplace with strong positives & negatives	 Senior Director	13 Oct 2015	3.0	Explicitly states that being an employer of choice is its core strategy. Works towards that in many ways with reasonably good perks and pay. Takes care of safety and work environment concerns. Normally one can expect a good work-life balance.	Highly political. With the nature of the payments business comes problems associated with too many people trying to chase the few big successes available. Not everyone has the opportunity (nor the skills in visa) to make a quantifiable difference to the P&L.

- Low morale working environment due to high turnover, re-org and frequent changes to work portfolio.
- Increasingly challenging business model where Opex increases outweigh revenue increases.
- Unfortunately, the cons outweigh an otherwise strong list of pros."
309	Bad middle management stemming from bad senior leadership	 Anonymous Employee	21 Jan 2015	2.0	Initially it was learning new things ... After a while it was the like minded colleagues that keep you going. Benefits was alright for an MNC.	"Politics was in every level of the company. Some bosses without guts will be ""eaten up"" alive, I guess survival instinct. Everything is short term and decisions are made at the expense of long term because lazy and incompetent managers want to hit KPIs and report only good news upwards. Re-org happens so often that nothing really gets accomplished, and predecessors always get away with bad decisions. 
And depending on the nationality of the managers, there appears to be a trend of hiring people of the same, not base in merit but base on network.
When HR folks start to leave the company, this is an good indication the company is too messy to stay."
310	Director	 Director	15 Oct 2014	4.0	"Great Working Culture
Professional People
Cross functional opportunities
Benefits"	"No vertical growth opportunities
Slow decision making"
311	Great place to work	 Director	14 Oct 2014	4.0	Work life balance, great people	Sometimes a project can take a long time before it launches.
312	Visa Inc.	 Business Leader	25 Sep 2014	4.0	A great company to work for - offers career progression and opportunity for professional growth. Visa has a reasonable work/life balance depending on geographic location.	Visa is a leading global brand with a very successful trackrecord however needs to change gear to compete with the much faster paced new technology companies that are entering the payments market.
313	Opportunities for growth limited by workplace politics and lack of collaboration	 Anonymous Employee	23 Sep 2014	3.0	"-Professionally run company, highly regulated business environment 
-Pay is OK, slightly above average. Benefits are strong. 
-Opportunities for growth and career markers/projects 
-Some really talented and hardworking people in the markets - hub was a different story"	"-Huge lack of leadership from senior directors and upper management
-Politics gets in the way of good work, prevents people from working towards one common goal 
-Massive reorgs left people fending for themselves, leaders in charge of people lost sight of what really mattered: talent retention and career growth
-Company is lost, upper management lack clear direction to inspire employees - many programs are being scaled back at the expense of industry leadership and vision"
314	Inept Management, unqalified staff. A good place to retire  or for lazy, ignorant people killing time	 Senior Customer Service Representative	10 Sep 2014	2.0	Easy to get in. Good salary compared to the job to be done. Good benefits. Good work/life balance. Good for people killing time better than being unemployed.	"Company prefer to keep a lot of people that are not able or willing to work. The work is done by a very few people but management is not consequent enough to deal with it properly. Cronyism is present any day. Promotion is for staff that have drinks with the right people, neither quality work nor reliability or efficiency in getting the job done is demanded. As for the reimbursements (e.g. health insurance) one sometimes had to wait up to half a year. Lot of sfaff satisfaction surveys but no proper analysis and therefore no improvement. Training is sometimes done by people that do not know half of what the staff already know. Supporting the ""wrong"" people leads to the best people leaving the company unhappily."
315	Great company to work for	 Anonymous Employee	9 Jul 2014	3.0	Pay, brand name, talented people	Lack of career growth options
316	Great Place to work	 Info Security	3 Jul 2014	5.0	Great Company, Learning curve, Safe place and business model	Constant reorg happening all time
317	A good place to learn new skills	 Account Manager	1 Jul 2014	4.0	Professionalism, good people in general, OK hours, OK salary	Very political, expect backstabbing via HR or Manager, some managers are only working on their own progress
318	Global Environment and experience	 Senior Business Leader	1 May 2014	4.0	"International Exposure
Performance based bonus / stocks
Exposure to emerging payments and technology 
Focus on training / development"	"Flat organisation limiting upward promotions
Local packages trail expatriate / foreign hires
Need to look at housing / education allowances
Senior managers tend to remain in jobs too long limiting career mobility of others"
319	Need to be highly adaptable to change to succeed here but overall a good company and benefits.	 Manager	27 Apr 2014	3.0	"Good branding, widely recognised company. Growth company, good financials, benefits.
Nice people, who are talented and supportive of their colleagues."	"Too frequent and drastic changes to organisation, makes it unsettling for most. Upper management.
Compensation and performance management processes need to improve to better reward and measure competencies and true talent."
320	Friendly and intellectual colleagues in a very supportive environment	 Intern	12 Mar 2014	5.0	Supportive and has a very structure programme in place. Doing real stuffs with the full time colleagues there	Everywhere you go.. you see Visa... even when you knock off from work.. when you are paying for items... you see your company logo and it appears to be a constant reminder that you have work undone.
321	Real Responsibilities!	 Intern	30 Jan 2014	4.0	Very structured internship. Lectures on overview of other departments are a good initiative. Worked on real projects with real responsibilities! Case competition was a good exposure for us to meet clients and present to senior management	interns hardly had a chance to be converted to full-time. Limited career progression. Should not focus too much on grades/interviews in recruitment
322	Not my best career decision	 Marketing	27 Jan 2014	3.0	Compensation is quite good, with a fairly decent work life balance.	Takes a certain type of aggressive character to be able to survive in this work culture. Not the best place for career advancement.
323	Visa has a work culture that allows you to interact with a very multi-national team.	 Digital Marketing Manager	22 Dec 2013	5.0	Perks and benefits are good.	Re structure could means more opportunities.
324	Nice place to work	 Information Security Analyst	4 Oct 2013	4.0	Good learning, Experienced management, Good benefits	No cons as such in mind
325	Great for internships	 	28 Sep 2013	4.0	"HR really cares about interns
Great exposure to the payments industry (tried Googling what I learnt - cannot find online!)
Can access a lot of information as long as you ask, great for self-learning
Flat structure, so as an intern, it's great to meet people
Employees are friendly to interns, willing to teach, and really fun and smart people in general
Had a smile at work every day"	"Can tell it's political, but there was a re-org recently
People won't share stuff if you don't ask; no culture of sharing
Each is very protective of their own department
Needs to be more stringent with letting interns in (some managers are tougher, some are not so), some are below average, diluting the prestige. Don't think it's good in the long run for attracting good candidates in future
No intern conversion (duh ^)"
326	future focused company	 Consultant	9 Sep 2013	4.0	lives up to its vision of being the world's best way to pay and be paid for everyone, everywhere	matrix cum consultative environment may sometmes slow the speed of execution
327	Great place to come in and be lost for life	 Senior Systems Analyst	14 Aug 2013	2.0	Leads the industry in the payment space. Historical advantage.	The place is turning into a sweat shop. Management is narrow minded and set in some very old ways. Growth is based on who you know and how you please them. Tow the line and grow fast.
328	Visa - employer of choice	 Anonymous Employee	29 Jul 2013	4.0	Innovative market leading company in the payments industry. Has a strong company culture which embraces specialist knowledge and is passionate about the industry.	Heavily matrixed environment, however once on board and you build a network it makes sense
329	Is it really a 360‚óã review?	 CSS	22 Jul 2013	3.0	Great people..good environment..great company leading in payment industry...good leadership at senior management level	There are some junior & mid-level leaders who judge by their own perspective rather by fact ..360‚óã review conducted in a way that it is being sent to 'intended' recipients only
330	Objective review of Visa Inc.	 Intern	14 Jun 2013	4.0	Great culture, benefits and resources. Has highly talented people from all backgrounds and nationalities for a diversified and international environment and working culture.	Hard to get in, really high expectations of everyone as the minimum bar is very high and minimum experience is 7 years in another company related to the current job scope.
331	Great place to work	 Anonymous Employee	1 May 2013	4.0	"Fast-paced and something new to learn everyday
No micromanaging and tons of autonomy
Great recognition of good work and talent
Good comp at least for my role"	Some processes are clunky - an Achilles Heel for organizations of its size
332	Good!	 Staff Software Engineer	22 Mar 2013	3.0	Fair compensation, Equal opportunity workplace, Good work life balance	Good compensation as per Singapore Peer standard  but not as competitive as other Visa worldwide locations, little laid back, very casual and non-uniform on-boarding procedures, too much of control from head office , limited carrier progress opportunity
333	better organization to choose Technology growth in Finance/banking sector	 Business Leader	5 Mar 2013	4.0	PTO, ability to work with multiple depts, personal/professional growth encouragement	continuous reorganization, climbing up the ladder not that easy
334	Great Company, bad management, worse leadership	 Anonymous Employee	21 Feb 2013	3.0	Great Brand and company. Market leader. Great team. Good money.	The management is extremely short sighted. Very poor leaders at senior level. The leaders are short sighted.  The HR leadership is the biggest challenge. A couple of good HR people have left and since then HR is managed by amateurs..
335	Lead Software Engineer	 Lead Software Engineer	16 Jan 2013	4.0	Good to start. Salary is as per the market rate. Better way to learn payment systems.	Need to work hard to get grow as a lot of older employees are there.
336	Operations Manager	 Operations Manager	19 Dec 2012	3.0	No.1 Brand and cutting-edge tech.	Large organization. Frequent staff change.
337	Management Pls take note	 Database Administrator	15 Dec 2012	1.0	Salary is good.Colleagues were good.	Retrenchments are so common. Too much Politics.
338	Power Struggle & Politics	 Risk Analyst	30 Nov 2012	1.0	Work-life balance, stable, interesting industry.	Office politics, stingy, no career progress. favoritism, unfair remuneration, employees are not appreciated, not innovative, lots of arrogant people.
339	Enriching & Empowering Summer Internship Experience	 Merchant Acquisition Intern	1 Sep 2012	4.0	"Interns allowed to take ownership of projects and challenge teammates' assumptions and point of views.

Business leaders bring interns to all (most) of internal corporate meetings and conference calls to keep them in the loop and up to date about project happenings. 

Nurturing and patient management mentors."	Nothing really bad to state.
340	Good Compensation but a lot of Politics	 	1 Apr 2012	3.0	"Good compensations - basic salary + allowance
Follows government mandated salary and contributions and number of Paid Time Off"	"Working late hours including weekends - no overtime pay in Singapore
Management in our team is not really good. 
Diversity score needs to be addressed and race needs to be diverse. There is only one race that are alarmingly too large in volume.
Politics everywhere."
341	Many ups and downs - a rollercoaster without safety restraints	 	26 Feb 2011	3.0	"Generally, the problems we work on are challenging...thorny issues from client deals to government relations.  These are real issues and there are no easy answers, or easy ways out - so we do have to think hard and act...and that's the rollercoaster.

Most of the people are good to work with, and they are sharp. If you want to work in the financial services/payments industry there is no better place to build a network."	"Although we work on thorny issues, I get the feeling that senior management will throw us under the bus in a heartbeat when push comes to the balance sheet...it's best to stand behind management, rather than out front.

This leads to a culture of insecurity, and a lack of ""intrapreneurship."" Continual layoffs add to the nail biting."
342	Ok	 Manager	31 May 2010	3.0	Depends on who you know. Does not reward fairly or transparently. Good place to be mediocre able to work with smart people	Could be fairer. Too many red tape and takes too long to make decisions. Management tend too be cliqued. Sad
343	GO Joe	 Business Analyst	9 Mar 2009	3.0	Most of the colleagues are good people, usually easy to work with. The compensation is quite good and there is always emphasis about family time. Visa encourages a healthy lifestyle and promotes participation in sporting events by absorbing the registration fee.	Too political at the management level, they are also very selfish. Too many times managers are obviously biased but are not bothered about it. Management suffers from Tunnel vision!!
