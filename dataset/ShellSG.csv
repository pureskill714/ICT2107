	Summary	Job Title	Date	Overall Rating	Pros	Cons
0	Comfortable Job	 Lab Technician	12 Mar 2023	4.0	- Keeps you occupied every hour - Decent pay for internship - Clear direction daily on what should be done	- Gets stale really quick and you dont learn much
1	Great place to work	 Commercial Operations	6 Mar 2023	4.0	Inclusive culture. Possible to have job rotation within the company. Embraces learning and growth. Mostly talented and responsible people who are friendly and helpful. Continuously trying to improve processes and efficiencies.	Slightly risk adverse. A lot of sign offs required to make a change or approve something new.
2	Great company to work for	 Trader	3 Mar 2023	5.0	Great company to work for.	Progression can be slow. Sometimes decision taking can be slow as in all big companies.

6	Ok	 Anonymous Employee	20 Feb 2023	3.0	- Genuine manager at least for me - Good work life balance - Good salary and bonus	- Due to thin segregation of duties, many stakeholders especially IT support. Kick you like a ball and many times no solution but eager to ask u to close the ticket. Need a one stop shop and more measurable metrics for IT. - Rather cold environment. Co-workers' respect for each other are not genuine but guided by company's value on respect. Appears friendly on the surface but badmouth behind one's back. - Overwhelming compliance courses to complete for new comers.
7	Organised Chaos	 Reliability Engineer	20 Feb 2023	2.0	Pay is one of the top in industry	"Toxic individuals who are part of the circle are constantly promoted. Rest are taken for granted.  Performance reviews are 100% subjective.

9	Great place for growth and experience, well cared for by genuine supervisors	 Internship	28 Jan 2023	5.0	- Supervisors genuinely care about your growth and try their best to give you challenging tasks - Work culture is quite relaxed but workers are always on task and passionate - Interns are given the opportunity to try whatever they want, bosses genuinely do care about your growth	- It requires interns to carefully think of what tasks is best suited for them. if you can't think of what you want to improve on or how you want to learn, it will be difficult to make your time here meaningful as well.

- They like their grads than experience hires. Esp those that fits their mould
- Hire and fire quickly
- Claim ""show care"" but very unauthentic: and wonders why their employer of choice score is lower than the other major oil.
- Looks glam outside, good reputation but v political inside.

Anonymous Employee	25 Apr 2021	5.0	Collaborative environment, helpful colleagues, bosses who are personally invested in your development, very inclusive people, and job rotations. Shell also walks the diversity talk and diversity isn't just a check in the box.	Sometimes a little too collaborative.

126	Good culture, but too much work offshore	 Finance Analyst	20 Apr 2021	4.0	Good culture, strong pay package	"While Management has clear direction on Energy Transition plans, time is needed to tell if these projects can be monetized.

128	Review for shell	 Engineer	14 Apr 2021	4.0	Good company for process chemical graduate	career opportunities are limited for engineers
129	Politics aplenty.	 Business Development Manager	13 Apr 2021	3.0	Big branded company. As a business development guy, it is relatively straight-forward when it comes to meeting client.	Politics! The politics there inter-department and inter-personal will really bring ur morale down.

138	First hand feedback after working for more than 5yrs	 Technologist	25 Mar 2021	5.0	Good company, good learning, multiple stakeholders management, reasonable salary package, and able to widen horizon on entire energy, fuel, chemicals supply chain	Not ideal for people who wants stability (like having a same role for more than 5 years), certain roles will require long working hours. Decision making process is very much dependent on mid level management steer and appetite for competitiveness, even though overall central executive team directions sound exciting. A lot of stakeholders to manage, a lot of time is spent on meetings (people in the company are kind of obsessed with having meetings), actual time left for proper planning/designing/in depth work are very limited (in my opinion).
139	Good  place to work for but lots of politics	 Advisor	25 Mar 2021	4.0	Culture is amazing, probably the best I’ve seen in terms of culture and really caring for employees.	Very slow moving to get things done and lots of politics to get promoted. It’s about who you know and network with and not about performance.

241	Shell Eastern Petroleum (Bukom)	 Anonymous Employee	17 Mar 2019	3.0	Excellent company and benefits. Strong safety culture.  Looks after contractors very well. Preached and practiced equality for all regardless of staff or contractors.	"Poor leadership  at all levels. Leaders only interested in results and not how  you get there.  Management willing to turn a blind eye to tyrant leaders as long as they deliver the KPIs. 

Locals born and bred in Singapore are often not hired, management citing locals not interested and no relevant experiences as not hiring locals.  
Interviews given to locals are often for formality sake with no real intention of hiring them. 

MOM/EDB should thoroughly check the hiring and interviewing procedures and why many locals are not given a chance to work here.  

If a  company based in Singapore do not even give a chance and groom the locals bred/born, then who else will?

Majority of the full time staff are not born/bred Singaporeans. (i.e. Engineering  & Maintenance dept)

More then half of the mid level management are not local born/bred."

280	Sales Manager	 Sales Manager	10 May 2015	4.0	A really great company with excellent training for their employees. Open and transparent in most cases and value staff to be open with them. Shell also has a great internal open recruitment system.	A huge company with a global presence, but despite really trying to be fully inclusive with employees and making you feel as though you are part of a large family, at the end of the day you really are just a cog in a big wheel.

286	Good company to work for	 Marketing Manager	8 Jun 2014	4.0	A good company with a strong brand, attract lots of smart talents. Good development and training programmes, strong value throughout the organisation and respected/practiced by every employees.	A lot of processes, sometimes too much time spent on managing processes. Tendency to over-engineer simple things, too much collaboration and rounds of engagements required before a decision can be made. The job rotations every few years require the employees to make their own career, make their own connections to secure next job they want.
287	Good company, great people and great benefits	 Human Resources Manager	17 May 2014	5.0	Good environment to work in, Above average remuneration and as a giant oil company certainly higher bonus then compared to smaller firms	Heavy workload, harder to promote since there are a lot of talented people around.
288	Brilliant minds and challenging environment	 Anonymous Intern	15 May 2014	5.0	I was fortunate to hone my communication skills through participating in several major projects such as F1 and Shell Eco-Marathon. The people were fantastic - always friendly, encouraging and most importantly fast thinkers. The company has a high turnover - but WITHIN the company itself, i.e. people were encouraged to switch departments to gain different experiences under Shell's umbrella of opportunities. As an intern, the communications department was an excellent place to start working and truly understanding the company.	While an efficient technical team is always available for assistance, the computer systems are pretty old and may be difficult for younger generations to adapt to. It also reduces efficiency, albeit to a small extent.

294	Great place to work!	 Business Analyst	15 Sep 2012	4.0	"There's a lot of trust in Shell.  Even as a fresh hire from university, right from the start, I was faced with real issues and had to solve them my way.
People take you seriously, no matter how junior you are.  As long as you have the drive to push something through, you will be heard."	"Due to the ~4 year job rotations, corporate learning does get affected as people move on to other roles.
While the general culture is that everyone can have a say on things, it does mean that decision making is generally slower."
