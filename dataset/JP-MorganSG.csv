107	Women first culture while Men get marginalised unless you bootlick	 Anonymous Employee	17 Dec 2021	2.0	You are really just working for the brand name. The Compensation is not competitive.	"Increasingly you might realise the company has a “woman-first” culture. If there are two equally capable candidates who are top performers, the female will be promoted first. This is very prevalent in internal mobility situations as well where you might realise in the top jobs, female candidates only require to meet the minimum criteria for the role to be accepted while males will be required to overcompensate for the same role to be moved forward. This is only for Analyst/Associate positions which generally is very still very junior. If females were in this position, they would be complaining that there is no gender equality. On this end, there must be controls to protect both females and males equality chances and not just conforming to social pressures to blindly give opportunities and chances to female candidates first.

For males to succeed in the company you probably need to bootlick well and play politics right to get promoted. I had a co-worker who was really close to my manager, didn’t contribute anything to the BAU tasks but was promoted twice in 2 years. They were so close such that even the spouse were friends with him. Clearly the promotion came from favouritism perspective.

Pay is not competitive and the firm is not trying to keep you. You will realise this once you start going for interviews for the same role."

424	Credit Documentation Analyst	 Credit Documentation Analyst	7 Nov 2015	4.0	Good benefits with people from diverse background and a variety of experience. In general, most of the employees are experienced and work with the company for a very long period of time. The senior management generally knows each individual at the company.	Long working hours like any other bank. Systems are a bit backward and certain things are still manual which is unexpected for such a prestigious bank.

428	Pretty Awesome Company	 Software Developer	1 Oct 2015	3.0	You get to work with awesome software engineers around you, and they are generally kind enough to guide you any time you need. You get great exposure to financial industry as well as banking.	I guess the biggest disadvantage is that you don't get as important a person as you would be in a smaller non-banking company. There are just too many awesome people around. Moreover, they value much more business than hard skills, which is not a good thing to a IT professional like me. This is why I decided to quit eventually.

The investment process used to be rigid with super smart humble results and process oriented teams. Now it's tilted to reward those who speak loudest.  Those with real substance re getting drowned out by those with form	No longer client first. Has become more like any other bank.

447	Great company run by Mr. Dimon	 Vice President	2 Oct 2014	5.0	Great place to work for where you are given accountability with responsibility.	The leadership has changed in a very big way to the extent you are unable to recognize the organization pre and post the financial crisis.
448	Great culture	 Analyst	24 Sep 2014	5.0	The people are awesome, great culture, good learning curve. I'd always leave with great memories in any of the JP Morgan offices. The money and staff welfare is not bad. Overall, it's a great place to be in.	Too much procedures can be painstakingly annoying, but it's a bank after all, so some might be a necessity.

456	Great brand... But!	 Associate	7 Jan 2014	3.0	Great brand value. Good pay. Excellent use of technologies. Cool HR policies and other stuff.	Too big to manage at times. Too much politics. Excessive bureaucracy. Always creating that fear amongst employees to perform or perish. Too many organization reshuffles. As a result ever changing objectives and deliverable.
457	Good company, but be aware of what you are building in your career	 Anonymous Intern	12 Dec 2013	3.0	Very nice people, good culture, good business and good career opportunity	The name is not everything- make sure you are learning the right things

465	If you're not in sales...	 Corporate Access & Investor Relations	27 May 2008	2.0	They allow junior employees to take on responsibility and get hands on experience.  In other words, you work hard and credit is given to you.  You may be the most junior in the team but you still get to face clients immediately when you're in front office.  You're not just assisting the head of the team.	Politics.  Wonder what senior management have in mind and whether they truly understand what is happening on the ground.  The 'team' culture is not that strong either.  It is good to be self motivated but most of the time, its better to work together with your team mates instead of trying to outshine everyone else.  The event or client etc is more important than trying to show off to others or claim credit.
