39	Don't buy the hype- Especially if you're joining as a temp or junior employee	 	17 Jan 2023	1.0	"1. Food and coffee's taken care of and its actually the most exciting part of your day apart from checking out. 2. Massively culturally diverse environment - you get to work with everyone from all over the globe if you're part of a regional team. Everyone's well travelled and you get the best tips for holiday planning 3. If you enjoy doing mindless tasks on top of your job scope which FTEs tend say are ""a huge waste of their time"" - you'll have plenty of that around and you'll be well paid to do that too."	"If you're considering to take on a temp role or treated like 3rd class citizens by FTEs, this is what your experience will be like: 1. Some white badges have a serious superioriy complex (usually Google purists who have been here >7 years) and truly e joy to refer to you discriminately as red badges or ""TVCs"". You're beneath them so don't expect to be treated with decent human respect. Some senior employees find every chance to diss you for having lower standards than Googlers and remind you that all the benefits you have are extended to you because of their goodwill. 2. DEI only applies to users and not TVCs. TVCs must be kept hidden away from senior management at all times. This includes removing all credit on work you've done and letting FTEs shine on your behalf. 3. Expect your mental health to take a toll if you don't have fellow temps on your team. You often find yourself excluded from team meetings, team lunches etc - and you'll hear all about the fun things they get to do over lunch. 4. You wonder why they hire you to do intern-kind of work even though you've got 10 years of experience. Googlers with less experience tell you what to do because they always know better. I really don't recommend you to stay here longer than you need to because a lot of such work only applies to companies as massive and unproductive as the big G. 5. Watch your FTE friends coast- have nice work-from-overseas-breaks every 2 months while you slog away to keep the ground running. Yet, you're absolutely the dispensable one. 6. They don't like to use outside tools and everything is built in house by aspiring engineers who are tasked to make transformative impact. 7. Everything takes FOREVER to be done here. Global calls all the shots and they don't understand how things work regionally. You find yourself going round in circles. Things that take 1 week to do outside usually gets done here in 3 months. There are just way too many people. No wonder investors keep calling for layoffs. It's too bloated and I have to agree. 8. Extremely messy and bureaucratic. Kind of hard to imagine for a tech company that marketed its employee culture so well. For anyone looking to join Google: 1. Most important skill you'll need to have to survive here: Google slides and google sheets. Throw away your other project management tools. Everything runs on these 2. And youll need to keep track of thousands of these because there's no centralised system to manage your tasks. 2. Don't join unless at a higher level (>L7). Otherwise your influence is 0 unless you do well at influencing. 3. Great brand name to have for sure, but your hard skills take a hit if you stay long enough. You'll definitely hone soft skills though. 4. Networking here is so important if you want to ever get things done. Very extrovert friendly. 5. Meetings galore! Well.. at least they're kept short."

311	Fantastic company, but screwed over in compensation	 Recruiting Coordinator	7 Feb 2021	4.0	Fantastic team in Singapore, free meals, gaming areas, coffee, snacks. Also free shuttle service to town, which saved a lot of money! Wonderful work environment that really cares about you. Also learned how to work quickly under a high workload.	"Yeah... TVCs are pretty much second-third class citizens in Google. A lot of stuff / projects are given to FTEs. Also not allowed to learn anything beyond your core role because you're a TVC. A lot of information is withheld from you because you don't have security clearance, and they don't want you to have it. Pre-covid no TVC in my team was allowed to WFH so there was not much flexibility, but other teams are actually allowed to, so there is a lot of inconsistency in how different TVCs are treated.

Also - and this is VERY important: Google contracts a bunch of external companies to provide TVCs, and each company has different paid time off days / salary ranges. I got screwed over because other TVCs in the same role as me was getting paid almost 1k per month more than me, and all of them had 14 days of PTO while I only got 12. Make sure you know what you're getting into when you sign the contract!

Pre-covid the FTEs could go on nice local offsites to chill / enjoy themselves while the TVCs had to stay back in the office and continue slaving. Very obvious different treatment that could be felt by everyone."

Great perks and benefits (especially a super generous medical coverage).	It gets a bit bureaucratic to do things/launch some things at times as everything needs to be thoroughly reviewed.

424	Great Opportunities; Lesser Job Satisfaction	 Anonymous Employee	21 May 2019	4.0	I shall not touch on the benefits as I think these are over discussed and obvious.  What I love about the company is the amalgamation of great minds, collaborative work, amazing opportunities (both work and personal), flat structure, continual education and the freedom to do your work as you seem fit without having to adhere to strict processes and protocols.	"- Your core job is mundane as they tend to hire over qualified people
- They tend to promote unqualified middle managers. I have had met teams where the subordinates are much more knowledgeable and capable than the managers.  This, many times made them lose great people.
- What you put hard work on might not materialize to fruition in the future as change is constant. Projects get scrapped all the time. In the end, you feel like you don't achieve much at all.
- Feels like a cult. When you work at Google, you live and breathe Google.
- Distracting work environment with so many going-ons, travels, open office, etc; hard to do work if you are not focused. 
- While they promote work life balance, the truth is, this is hard to have since there are so many projects, changes, travels and filtering of information to have a decent work life balance 
- Ridiculous amounts of unnecessary meetings"

446	Comfortable Working Environment	 Account Strategist	7 May 2017	4.0	The working environment is very comfortable. Most people are smart, friendly, and love the company. The total salary package is well over the market rates.	As the company grows bigger, it's becoming more and more political. If you're not an engineer then getting good performance ratings and promotion takes a bit of skills.
447	Associate	 Sales Associate	25 Apr 2017	4.0	"For contract staff, we do get a great amount of benefits. Free food and snacks means you can save your lunch & tea time money. Basic healthcare benefits. Coworkers were great, everybody operates on an open culture, you can speak to any one about anything as long as you take the initiative to ask. 

I was on small team with flat hierarchy. We were given alot of freedom to call the shots as long as we felt it was good for the market. The team rarely did overtime, there was little to no micro management as long as we showed results at the end of the day."	"Towards the end of my contract, it became clear that politics from upper management was trickling downwards. Team members were let go because the project was unstable, kept changing business directions and it was obvious the management couldn't plan ahead - constantly asking us to be patient with sudden changes, making it hard for my team to churn out consistent messaging for our clients. 

Often, my team would be the last to know of any changes even though we were the ones doing ALL the groundwork. 

Managers started being more apparent in looking out for themselves, instead of for the team. At times, they would even drag members into their drama. Completely unnecessary."

Those in leadership positions exploit middle management and force others to slave away while they do little
Bosses in Asia get by by outright bullying and favouritism; Plus everything that could be done is already done so the work is far from creative and inspiring

The sales floor is full of unmotivated, uninspiring, untalented people who are perfectly happy coasting by as they can never get fired. As a young grad who wants to learn and make an impact, it was disappointing. 
Also lots of people get ahead by ""playing the game"" and SO MUCH POLITICS. It was truly sad to see untalented (some even downright stupid) people get ahead."

475	Not what I was hoping for	 Anonymous Contractor	20 Dec 2013	3.0	Like everyone says, it really is a great place to work (under the right conditions).  The food is wonderful and the offices are whimsical and spacious.  Nice decorations and abundant supplies of snacks and stationery are never far from you.  Tons of highly intelligent people float through the hallways, and the atmosphere is very fun and stimulating.	It wasn't fun for me, because of my team.  It really depends on the team you're placed in.  I was in people operations, and the volume of email that went around was enormous.  Overtime was a regularity for me day in and day out.  Way too much attention to minute details that weren't essential to the workflow.  Little chance for conversion to permanent status.  I had no time for lunch and couldn't even socialize like people in the other teams could.  The stress and repetitiveness weren't worth the terms in my temporary assignment contract.

Risk management is still very new to all the teams and still need lots of education efforts
