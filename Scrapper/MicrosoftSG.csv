- cool activities, like online workout classes or Mental Health days
- it could be a ""retirement job"" with good work-life balance if you just to what is asked of you, and don't take any initiatives.
- very good and talented people. amazing opportunities to work on projects with people from across regions.
- the office is beautiful!
- work from home is encouraged, but you can practically work from anywhere!
- pride of working at a company like that"	"- as a contractor, I am delegated the tasks others don't want to do; there is no much impact of your job. even if you do take initiatives, it won't be noticed or rewarded. it often feels like contractors are invisible and irrelevant.

- the company is huge and it is very dispersed. sometimes communication between departments feels like you are communicating with a different company

- no clear processes on how to follow certain procedures, yet they all have to be compliant - you need to figure it out on your own

- there is a lack of culture of belonging, esp. in WFH era. I have only seen 2 of my colleagues in real life; and it's hard to feel connected with them. cultural events, learnings, activities are mostly targeted toward internal employees. external employees not always have access. I wanted to do a certification and upskilling, but it's not covered for me.

- I was given a work device with a damaged keyboard. the process to ask for a proper one is very hard and tedious.

- there is a clause that doesn't allow you to be hired by Microsoft again for 6 months after your contract ends. also, haven't heard of anyone who was able to convert from external to internal staff."

Still, I believe the people are top-notch with business manner, mindset, resourceful and brain and it has the world class marketing model and business structure.  Yeah you wouldn't probably believe me, but try somewhere else, then you will know what I mean.	The company is mature, which means sometimes it requires lots of layers and processes. I was working in Asia-Pacific Headquarters and there are waves like all the majority of people in the team are from 1 country, where even had no relevance.  to Asia at all.

163	Middle management bullying and politics	 Anonymous Employee	31 Aug 2019	2.0	"- Flexible, working from home accepted and encouraged, however takes more effort to establish work relationships.
- Benefits are good when compared to non-IT companies."	"- Many silos in the company with obscure roles. This is a place for people to hide their incompetence, particularly middle management.  

- Bullying is dismissed when escalated to senior leadership. HR function largely outsourced and impersonal. There are pages of instructions on what to do and how grievances are handled but no clear accountability. 

- Incredibly political and bureaucratic. It’s about who you know to get ahead, not your merits or performance. If your manager does not support you (or worse still, take credit for your work) you won’t get anywhere. 

- Feedback is ignored. 

- If you’re ambitious and want to make a difference or grow in your career, don’t come here. You’ll be frustrated and pushing constantly uphill. Whilst the growth mindset is preached, it’s not the reality. The culture doesn’t support it, the reporting lines don’t support it and least of all, management doesn’t support it. 

- Middle management spin their wheels to justify their existence - lots of micromanaging, doing things for the sake of it rather than what is efficient or effective."
164	Fast paced environment with many career opportunities	 Solution Sales Specialist	20 Aug 2019	5.0	If you love working in teams in a highly dynamic environment with fast evolving technology, this is an amazing place! With the size of the business, it also brings many career opportunities with colleagues from all over the world. Been here for 8 years and will hang on until they kick me out! Although not easy everyday with the speed of change and the amount of work, I'm having the fun of a lifetime.	The organization is a matrix with multiple stakeholders to manage, if you're an individualist more than a team player, not the place to be. Navigating it to get things done is complex, if you can't deal with internal complexity and sometimes chaos, not the place to be. If you are not comfortable with ambiguity and with change, neither a place to be.

210	Long time employee in SMSG	 Anonymous Employee	15 Apr 2016	5.0	I've been with Microsoft over 25 years so I am going to perhaps demonstrate some bias.  I've worked in Australia, UK and now Singapore, all as a result of finding roles to grow and develop in the company.  So great experience there.  Recently since the Satya era, the companies agility has notably improved as its moved on from the Windows only legacy.	The company has an obsession with analytics and reporting.  Depending on your role, you may find yourself buried under an expectation of talking about what you need to do and showing why you need to do it, vs. doing it
211	Culture and People	 Senior Marketing Manager	11 Apr 2016	4.0	Really brilliant people, still growing and new CEO is amazing!	Tussle between old MS and new MS within ranks.  Transformation is taking a toll on some.
212	Industry Market Development Manager Intern	 Industry Market Development Manager	22 Mar 2016	4.0	Mobile Work space. Very flexible with working hours. People are friendly and welcoming during social gatherings and team bonding sessions.	Flexible working hours can be a double edged sword. There's no fine line between working hours and free time. Microsoft has so many services and so many products and the business model is complex.
213	Senior manager	 Senior X Manager	20 Mar 2016	1.0	Paid reasonably. Kept busy with work. The full time employees were generally smart and capable people. Not the most international in outlook but still above average.	Worked in the Singapore operations Centre. Culture felt less than progressive--people were managed by fear rather than by empowerment and motivation. The general management team at the time did not impress me. To me they lacked breadth of thinking and international exposure.  The company was too complex and a few structural impediments surfaced during the quarterly forecasting and annual budgeting cycles.  employees focused on their own worlds with little cross functional collaboration. Those employed as contractors were made to feel like second class and it showed in their low morale. Desperately need outside perspectives by way of fresh blood across the board.
214	Retrenchment is getting to be a norm	 Regional Marketing Manager	15 Mar 2016	1.0	Flexi-work hour, work life balance, smart colleagues, good technology and infrastructure with decent pay outs.

223	Great place to work, but APJ has some issues	 Anonymous Employee	5 Nov 2015	3.0	Having worked in both Redmond and APJ, I can say that the culture in Redmond is much better.  More training, more competent people, less eager to trample you on their way up, and work-life balance in Redmond is just better.	More nose-to-the-grindstone in APJ, with less time for home, family.  Obviously much more sales-driven in the region that at HQ, but this carries over to winning the sale at all costs, and little focus on selling what the customer actually needs.
224	Review of Operations	 	26 Oct 2015	3.0	Good Branding, Good CEO with the right ideas and steering the company's direction. Getting to use all the best productivity software that the company makes. Decent benefits for employees in Asia comparatively to similar companies in the region.	Punishing work culture, work-life balance does not exist. Too much emphasis on going for only high impact visibility that discounted the importance of the needful to be done that keeps the engines running; thus Performance reviews are subjective, based on what you had on your current portfolio given by manager. Diluted customer focus. Changes in organisational structure are too fast and too unmanaged.
225	Best Practice HR	 Staffing Consultant	6 Oct 2015	4.0	"Cutting edge HR practices (flexible work, diversity, employee trust)

226	Review of my experience in Microsoft	 Audience Manager	27 Sep 2015	4.0	Working in Microsoft, one is exposed to a diverse group of folks with different backgrounds and experiences. The company offers a degree of flexibility in work arrangement, which is beneficial to a mature workforce. There is large emphasis on impact of deliverables and how it is achieved.	As with a number of places, a large degree of support comes from the manager and his/her leadership style. Despite the degree of flexibility available, work is hectic due to high workload - work / life balance is a consistent challenging topic year over year.
227	Great place to work	 Marketing Program Manager	3 Sep 2015	4.0	Great exposure and you'll get to work with really smart people. Therefore, there are lots of learning opportunities and always be at the forefront of latest tech solution. Microsoft is now more humble in her approach and the company is shifting to growth mindset. Proud to be part of Microsoft.	Microsoft corporate structure is complex and may be a very challenging environment for those who have not have any working experience in matrix organisation. Very fast moving company and much efforts are spent on internal lobbying. The constant reorganization and leadership shift coupled with less than effective change management creates unnecessary insecurity and confusion.
228	Regional Operations Program Manager	 	31 Aug 2015	3.0	Work time flexibility, good pay, for those who can sell themselves, this is heaven.	Regional job requires a lot of night calls. A company who doesn't want to retain long service employees. Highly political environment.
229	SMS&P	 Anonymous Employee	23 Aug 2015	5.0	Fast moving, demanding and professional organization.  Colleagues are generally very capable, with a positive attitude and collaborative.  Microsoft hires good people.  Role rotation every few years keeps the job interesting and provides for a broader, more well-rounded employee.  A great place to work.	Time commitments are considerable and if you are in a regional role expect to spend time away from home.  The company competes across many product areas resulting in a matrix organization chart that can be overwhelming.  There is a considerable amount of time and resources devoted to reporting internally.  The job rotation every few years can be a distraction for customers and partners.
230	Incredibly Intelligent and Dedicated Environment	 General Manager	4 Aug 2015	4.0	"Supporting teams and organisations (to be point of being tribal :))

234	mediocre middle mgmt who are too scared to do the right thing for the company.	 Program Manager	9 Jun 2015	3.0	"- Nice office space , free snack and drinks in pantry. 

- Having first hand experience on the latest technology and software/tool

- Meeting many passionate and smart people under the same roof especially in support teams who genuinely wants to make a difference for the company. 

- Flexibility to work from home / remotely with manager's approval 

- The overall compensation package for FTEs is pretty competitive in today's market ( great insurance coverage + flexi cash + medical )  

- Great exposure if one is looking for gain experience in a complex environment / working with multiple stakeholders."	"- Lack of clear direction from middle mgmt and leadership team. News cascaded down are usually late or over generalised, leaving it up to your own imagination/interpretation (because you are not high-level enough) to hear the real situation. 

- Do not expect any kind mentorship on your own career growth. The middle mgmt managers are too caught up with their personal agenda and 'showing visibility' to their intended target audience trying secure their own jobs/ looking for next move. They have little interest in being mentors to their directs nor investing time to make their own team successful. 

- Despite hiring all the highly qualified and skilled candidates, the management has little tolerance for alternative voice. The mid level managers generally expects 'Yes' man, no questions asked type of behaviour. They will also resort to petty and biased actions to get back at you for 'disobeying' them by giving you a negative testimonial/performance appraisal. period.

- The open secret is : How well you climb in this company is not truly dependant on your performance but how well you network and show your visibility to the right people. Quarter after quarter, it encourages people to form alliance to ""scratch each other's back"". Typically such alliance will come up with some random rubbish project that has no real impact to the business nor help to solve real customer issues. They use up a whole lot of resource from support teams to do all the dirty work for them and at the end of it, they get all the credits and praises for ""leaning in"" 

- Many of the mid level managers are long timers ( >10 years) , they know the game so well hence they are too afraid to try or do anything different for fear of losing their jobs. 

- Stack ranking. The performance review system is time consuming, a lengthy process and final evaluation is flawed & biased. Employees of the same BU & of the same ranks are pitted against each other. Only 10% will be the top performers and 20% will be average performers , leaving 70% of the entire crew falling into the lower trench. What's the point of making 70% of the crew feeling like they are failures in their job when they are not ??  Of course, MS have since embarked on new review system that is less time consuming but the methodology of grading the staff has not yet evolved - basically new skin but same crappy insides."

This way you tend to broaden the circle of people you talk to, beyond you own team.	Self discipline is key. Depending on which team you're in, most don't have their superiors breathing down their necks. Hence, you've to be strict with yourself and make sure you complete your tasks at the required deadline.
240	Good and bad	 Program Manager	29 Dec 2014	4.0	I like the office and the culture, everyone is helpful and working towards same goal, minimal politics	Most of the junior to mid level employees are contract staff with yearly renewal. Not good if you are looking for job security.
241	Good company but bad management	 Sales Manager	29 Nov 2014	2.0	"- Being sales, when you reach out to your clients, they KNOW you. Good points. 
- Friends will say ""wow, you are with Microsoft"". Good marketing.
- Inner engine - huge and many. (but this is also cons as too many, no focus)
- Good pay."	"- New management - don't know much about the historical sales, loading unreasonable quota and poor balanced of accounts assignment.
- Senior sales gets lower quota, but better accounts set. And those with strong buying power verticals, get lower quota.
- You do your homework of which account to get, but management with favouritism, gives to other sales rep! 
- Too much administrative work. Too many meetings. No time to do your work, but who cares, you still need to meet your target.
- No promotion. No increment! While company is making huge profit. Money goes to...you know i know.
- You must be outspoken, well-known, else you are stuck! Those shy, low-profile, introvert, don't think of joining this company, just the thoughts.
- Too many trainings, but not useful. Waste of time."
242	Great place to work	 Sales Associate	23 Nov 2014	3.0	Great worklife balance; company values diversity	limited employee benefits; tough to become a FTE
243	A once great company that lost its way	 Director	15 Sep 2014	4.0	Work with smart people (most of them at least), autonomy, allowing you to own and take action on things you believe in, flexible hours, good benefits, fun and always learning new things	Flexible hours means longer working hours as you tend to check emails all the time, compensation started to deteriorate over time with share award getting lesser and lesser, review system generally killed the original culture of being great place to work, and turn everyone into politicking animals, promoting the wrong people to managers,
244	Live Life & Work Wonders with Passionate, Talented, Ethical & Inspirational Teams :)	 Individual Contributor	10 Sep 2014	5.0	"No politics at IC Level in the subsidiary in every segment
Great work flexibility
Smart People with Great Ideas
Special Projects Encouraged"	"Dealing with Corporate & GEO folks
Managing time to work flexibility & deliver positive results
Learning how to work in teams with Smart People with Great Ideas

245	Energetic, Sales-Driven company	 Solution Manager	1 Sep 2014	4.0	"Organization charged with high energy. Great to work with the smartest people on the planet.
Lots of opportunities for exposure."	"Doing too much with too little resources.
Everyone has high expectations of others, leading to an environment which is very stressful and pressurized."
246	More job related training.	 Operations Specialist	9 Jun 2014	3.0	Great place to work in..	Should have more opening for contract staffs
247	Has lost its flair	 Senior Program Manager	9 Jun 2014	3.0	Above average salary, still a good name to have on your resume, very diverse work environment, great for networking, if you are lucky and got a great manager you can enjoy it a lot	Too numbers driven, people don't count as much anymore, a lot of internal politics, a lot of de-motivated people, it is common to change your job every 2 years, so it is very unstable
248	Internal politics help lead most astray	 Marketing Director	21 May 2014	3.0	Lots of amazing people and an exceptional product range - albeit a little confusing	"Lots of horrible internal politics and people succeeding because of the politics. 
In my 6 years at MS in Singapore I saw dozens of very good people leave because of stupid politics and even dumber HR guidance. Managers that are struggling to meet some of their business KPIs will make sure they meet their ""diversity"" KPI so they will hire and promote certain people just to hit that target. So when the business is not doing well the system makes managers promote people for their race or gender, not their performance. The GFC wasn't a major issue in APAC but things did slow in some areas and there were plenty of under-qualified people getting jobs and recognition that shouldn't have.
I was told point blank ""I would love to consider you for xxx role but I wouldn't be able to have a white male in the job. I have to hire an Asian female."" That was from a VERY senior exec (ie: partner level) and he/she didn't bat an eyelid when he/she said it. I was gobsmacked!
Surprisingly it makes it very hard for the solid performers rise to the top because they are often trodden on by climbers who take credit for work that is not theirs or get discredited by others who are looking for scapegoats."
249	Great place to work	 Analyst	8 Mar 2014	5.0	Flexible work schedule. Great, smart people. Challenging work.	-vendor model. Sometimes groups work in silos.
250	Different culture in both APAC & APOC office. You will lucky to get to APAC where I would said its norm MNC culture;	 Project Manager	12 Feb 2014	1.0	Its top notch working environment	many politics to fight for existence, not much real jobs done
251	great	 Marketing Specialist	4 Feb 2014	4.0	lot of opportunity with in	limited iwht the innovation and go to market
252	Sales @ Microsoft	 Sales Director	28 Jan 2014	3.0	Benefits and work life balance	Huge amount of unecessary reviews to make the bosses look smart and good!
253	Fantastic opportunities if you want to play the politics to get ahead, a great fit	 Manager	6 Nov 2013	2.0	Technology is fantastic, they live and breath their products which is a good endorsement for customers.  Good flexibility using technology and they do think about fairness in treating people	"Corporate is so big and powerful that it drives business irrelevant activities down the line. 
Processes are way too complex and get in the way of getting your actual job done. 
Outsourcing has gone way too far and the company couldn't operate without the 200K+ vendors and contingent staff - so much wasted money and capability."
254	In a holding pattern as leadership changes	 Director	12 Oct 2013	3.0	Lots of revenue and lots of job opportunities	Waiting for new leadership that can see around the corner.
255	Awesome all up	 Human Resources Leader	18 Aug 2013	5.0	The People, The Ethic, The Technology	Time for Steve Ballmer to handover the reigns
256	Pros & cons of a contract staff	 Project Manager	18 May 2013	4.0	Great office amenities - all sorts of drinks in the pantry, fruits every few days stocked. Ok location, pretty centralized. Friendly colleagues, good work life balance. Stress levels generally manageable.	Work for contract staff can be repetitive and gets boring after a while. Little to no training for contract staff, progressing to a full time employee can be tough but not impossible. No performance review can affect career progression.
257	Extraordinary company that has lost its way...	 Anonymous Employee	2 Apr 2013	3.0	Microsoft provides a great training ground to really grow your professional skills - sales, marketing, program management, etc.	Quotas and targets in recent years have been unrealistic. Even when someone accomplishes their goals despite the odds, very little recognition is given.
258	Big, slow, directionless.	 Senior Software Developer	17 Mar 2013	2.0	Great perks, American style compensation	Tough environment.  Very competitive.  Too much red tape from Singapore.  Cant get anything done.  Feel like a useless cog pushing papers and reports.
259	Fantastic and Innovative Company that might finally be slipping into middle age	 Director	8 Oct 2012	4.0	Passionate people, huge scope, broad set of types of jobs available (location, function, product line, etc.), giving spirit started by Bill Gates but still reflected today.	Process has become heavy, internal struggles among the top-most leadership have worn thin.
260	In company of high IQ execution oriented people	 Regional Lead (Shared Access)	3 Sep 2012	5.0	"Very intelligent colleagues, super smart
Varied interests and hobbies pilot to scuba divers
Highly self critical and direct"	The realization that one is the smart brings a bit of arrogance in culture
261	10 years and still growing strong	 Services	12 Aug 2012	4.0	"- very committed colleagues and friends
- very focus on customers
- flexibility"	"- different groups are driven by different commitments
- disconnect between tops and the field"
262	Culture	 Anonymous Employee	24 Jul 2012	5.0	"Open and respect
people help with each other"	sometime you gotta be sophisticated
263	Microsoft values people	 Operations Manager	16 Jul 2012	4.0	Flexibility to maintain work life balance	voice of the ground can be hard to get through to the top
264	IT system specialist	 IT Systems Specialist	27 Jun 2012	4.0	Great workig environment, helping peers	organization changes too quick with insufficient planning
265	Challenging and full of opportunities who goes out and look for it...	 Account Manager	13 Jun 2012	4.0	There is always open opportunities at Microsoft which makes it easy to move around and learn new stuff and experiences.	The company is now getting larger and as such it has lost some of it's start-up allure which makes it rather sad.
266	Challenging, get connected to the 'network' to move forward	 	27 Oct 2011	3.0	Access to great tools and technologies, generally fair employer.	'networks' that you need to be connected to.
267	Great place to get your hands dirty on great technology and be supported by awesome people.	 	10 Oct 2011	4.0	"Great People
Interesting diversity in technology
Interesting challenges
Focus on balancing Work and Personal Life
New move towards flexible workstyle with no desks"	"Some frustrations with career progression between subsidiary and regional team.
Location of office makes parking expensive and challenging to secure"
268	Unnecessarily complicated	 Marketing Manager	23 Mar 2011	4.0	"- Intellectually very challenging and enriching -- plenty of very very smart people around you because of Microsoft candidate screening process
- Management very open to feedback and when they are not, there are independent internal processes that channel your feedback anonymously"	"- Not too much product innovation so it can be pretty boring for a marketing person
- Dominant market share, huge chunk of cash in the bank means there is no hunger to be better and all the talent hired don't have too many ""real life-and-death"" challenges to deal with and as a result focus their intellectual power on internal processes, perfecting them, honing them. Result: Things get unnecessarily complicated. The culture of complexity in this organization is amazing -- and it shows in Microsoft products."
269	Underpaid, undervalued, but fun	 Summer Intern	25 Jan 2011	4.0	Summer internship was generally fun, and allowed you to interact with different departments.	Low in terms of career prospects or really getting to know the business. Pay was extremely low too.
