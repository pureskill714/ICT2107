1	Worth a place to work for	 IT Architect	15 Mar 2023	5.0	Mutual respect, Flexibility, Good work culture	It's more US-centric if you are in a global team
2	Unethical managers	 Senior Product Engineer	7 Mar 2023	2.0	- Good benefits (flexi benefits, insurance, etc.) - Working from home is okay as long as your manager is informed beforehand and you do not have to be on-site on that day to oversee projects - Engineers are competent and down-to-earth	"- Managers in my department are more interested in shallow publicity (quote: ""as long as it looks good"") than actual engineering functionality and reliability. - Some managers are unethical and use fear to motivate employees rather than creating a positive work environment. There are even managers who lack integrity and honour, reneging on agreements. My direct manager is a habitual liar, constantly trying to manipulate us and create team friction by telling each of us falsehoods about one another. Fortunately, my team lunches together and we found out from one another about his dishonesty. - Base salaries, increments, and bonuses are below the market rate. - Even though job rotations are lauded as a perk of working in HP, in reality, managers often block applications to rotate to other departments. - Some colleagues who are average performers have not been promoted for over 6 years."

4	Get in, get out and don't look back	 Senior Product Manager	5 Mar 2023	3.0	Processes are clear. Peers are mostly great. Hit and miss with regards to bosses. If you're lucky, you'll work for someone great, otherwise, good luck.	Progression is slow as hell. Directors and VPs almost always get to keep their jobs. Everyone else can just be stationary and expect horizontal movements. There is little opportunity outside if you stay for too long, Get in, get out quick, and don't look back. The scope of work here has no future, unless of course if you are a Director/VP/C suite.

269	A great place to grow, for fresh grads or early career starters	 Marketing Intern	2 Apr 2020	4.0	Personally, I was lucky to work with a supportive team who was dedicated to teach and guide me about the internal operations.  I was also given fair amount of autonomy to take charge of smaller projects, and was exposed to various cross-functional/market project meetings which have really expanded my knowledge of marketing and working life in an MNC. The culture there is mostly healthy as well - they encourage employees to be open, values-driven, and have a thirst to innovate.	"Even though I didn't experience it first-hand, I have witnessed the difficulties in learning how to manage different colleagues and people; some people have differing interests and intentions which may cause misalignment or conflicts during projects.
Lean on headcount, therefore some teams can be overstretched, and seems to be little room for promotions within the next few years, at least in Singapore."

299	Great place to work but lots of reorganizations happening recently	 Compliance Officer	24 Jul 2019	4.0	"1. HP Culture - people are generally friendly.  generally feels like a happy environment
2. Collaborative - most of your work requires you to sync up with people from other departments."	"1. Career Development - there is not much training happening in my organization such as certifications to help with career growth.  It can feel you are stuck and don't feel any career progression.
2. Work-life Balance - although top management try to make this as a priority, introducing people initiatives like global wellness challenge, but if you are working in operations, you still have to work after hours and have late night calls especially if you are part of the Global function. After the late night call, you are still expected to be in the office the day after and can really be tiring and detrimental to ones health."
300	giant going down	 Business Operations Manager	20 Jul 2019	3.0	No matter what, HP is still a big name that is useful when you interview. Some processes have been mature for many years so you can still learn a lot. Work life balance is good here.	the company is too big to change and many people are too stubborn to change too.

324	Stable but in IT No Career Advancement	 Anonymous Contractor	2 Dec 2018	3.0	Job security was decent. The work role itself was stable with manageable changes and incremental technology advancements to give a reasonable challenge. The staff members I served as part of my role were typically reasonable and polite. Local management was very reasonable and receptive to requests. Flexible work options were possible.	Contract employees do the same amount of work and shoulder the same amount of responsibility full time employees do but do not get any of the employee benefits they do. There was no room at all for career advancement. Chances of conversion to a permanent role did not exist in the few years I spent there. Interference and red tape from an upper management which not value or understand the job role was a problem. Local management did not have the backbone to deal with this. This led to dealing with some impossible situations.

Generally older workforce in the company and information and skillset transfer is inadequate when staff retires and new staff is hired to take over, resulting in delay for new staff to get online

Not dreaming big enough and taking risks to propel the company for the future

Too much focus on cost down activities

Compensation is not competitive enough

Not enough  job rotation to keep staff engaged to reduce silo mindset"

345	Missing it.. Regret leaving	 Anonymous Employee	13 Feb 2018	5.0	Good work life balance, caring management, friendly people, beautiful office	Workforce reduction happening constantly, though HP is humane enough to let you know way in advance (1 year) if you are one of the people they foresee they may have to let go. Active outsourcing to Mexico, Poland and India, one for each region, always got to keep on your toes and work extra hard if you don't want to be outsourced.

- Nice people to work with, was able to learn a lot about engineering work discipline and example of good team dynamic that goes into making a product
- Good work environment, no stressful micro-management all the time
- More result oriented, so you are sort of free (still need to adhere to rules and etiquette that is) on how to do your job as long as it is done on time
- Reasonably good HR experience as well. Really helpful during the first time entering the company 
- Everyone seem to be given some chances to express ideas or potential innovation. Even interns are sometimes invited to (seemingly, not too sure about outcome of ideas that were actually given) present/propose possible ideas of innovation for the company"	"- Actual management can still be improved upon to make teams more livelier and better bonded with other groups.
- Relatively not so competitive salary when compared to other IT-based company
- Not so much innovation or drive for innovation was happening, and printer business was relatively hard to capitalize on
- Back then, not so much diversification attempt as well (in Singapore division that is). 
- Most of the work there will be usually be related to one product type (aka printers), and not so much opportunity to  work on other product types that HP also develop (laptops, PCs, etc.)"
