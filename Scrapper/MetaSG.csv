- Relatively easy to get into. Easier interviews. Good stepping stone if getting opportunity from non FAANG background."	"- Not a place for planning you career long term. People will be hired externally on higher levels than someone getting promoted internally despite high performance ratings. 
- Metrics driven. Managers LOVE numbers, no matter how far-fetched, projected, approximated they are. If you can't show impact in numbers, don't pick up the project.
- 3-4 months projects are considered ""long term"" projects. Don't be mistaken for anything otherwise. Show your impact and move on. 
- Growth is stagnant in many orgs. Be careful while joining and find out as much as you can during interviews. 
- No team cares about customers. Good luck if you're joining into sales, account management or support. You're on your own."

27	Amazing work culture and people!	 Insights Manager	9 Dec 2022	4.0	Working with the best minds, the people at Meta is what makes the experience so amazing. Yes, there's the gastronomical food, wonderful office etc. But it's really the people who defined the experience. People are smart, with strong ownership and respectful of different expertise and POVs. The company values authenticity and celebrates wins, making it a comfortable and rewarding place to work in . My boss was really supportive, empathetic and transparent; really enjoyed my time with her. There are sufficient tools to do good work, and opportunities everywhere to choose who/what you want to work with, and create impact.	Contract workers are treated as second class citizens.. Uneven perks aside, contracts were renewed every 6 months, which is honestly unnerving... Contract workers do not get opportunity to switch to full-time role - have to go through the hiring process like everyone else. And usually there's no headcount, hence the CW role.

66	Nightmare	 Data Centre Engineer	28 Jul 2022	1.0	Meta offers many great perks, as with the Tech companies.	"Do not mistaken the Singapore  Data Centre to be the Tech Giant Meta. They are totally different. 

- The management in data centre does not embody Meta culture. The culture in data centre is worse than small medium enterprises. Employees are expected to be yes men, not to raise any questions or even provide feedback. You'll be targeted by management and your performance appraisal will suffer. 

- In the data centre, many perks given by Meta are not applicable to you if you are not a manager. Management said you are not to ""take advantage of the company "" so don't assume the perks such as Global travel days, or even claims of mileage for work purpose to be allowed. They will be rejected by your line manager.

- Overall culture is non-supportive and toxic with no flexibility. Expected to work in site office 5 days a week.

- Data centre hired people who aren't very competent or capable. It's really puzzling , guess the loop interview is not working. 

- No career progress, almost impossible to get promoted.

- Meta prides itself as a company that supports diversity but the Data centre is a strong supporter of CECA.

- Avoid at all costs unless you are a yes man."

3. Not all managers will lead, mentor or protect the team. Manager encountered saw most feedbacks as problems, rather than understanding reasons that led to this (politics, gaps from org changes, etc) and solving it with you. 
4. Sharing with clients that KPI is not tied to sales. When feedbacks from sales team are most crucial to performance reviews.

Work Culture is good in most of the aspects
Free food
Travel to different facebook offices
Talented and Ambitious peers, push you to grow"	"While the overall experience at Facbooks is reasonably good, depending on the team, quality of projects/work may vary from excellent to pathetic. 
Need to bargain hard on your CTC while joining the company to safeguard your interests. Managers have absolutely NO say in your compensation and wont be able to help you even if you perform well.
One should always interview for the Software Engineer position, which has slightly better pay, more opportunities to move around, different (better?) evaluation standards!

If you end up in a team which has no clear charter, you are expected to find your own work while the managers would not support you with this

Work life balance is average at best. You are expected to work a lot and it is more so if you want to grow to higher levels.In my opinion, people who have a strong career growth, don't have much time left and burnout often."

272	Toxic culture, work politics at its worst	 Communications Specialist	21 Feb 2020	2.0	"1. Colleagues are smart and you learn a lot from them
2. Good perks and benefits"	"1. Everything depends on the whims and fancies of your manager. If you've got a horrible one, beware, you'll be on a leash all your time here.
2. Work culture in the marketing, policy and comms team is super competitive, toxic, isolating and bullying is encouraged.
3. Despite raising concerns to HR about bullying, nothing is done about it and poor managers are rewarded.
4. Company is in an insecure state right now which trickles down to every level of management. Frequent back stabbing, anonymous feedback that harms you and bullying is rampant within teams. 
5. They rely on their ability as the world's largest social media site to get get talented people but do nothing to develop them or encourage honest and fair performance reviews. The PSC process is rigged from the start with low performers getting promoted and actual performers punished for speaking their mind. Its a Yes culture. Don't disagree with anyone if you want to survive here."

275	Business Solutions	 Anonymous Contractor	14 Dec 2019	4.0	Good working environment. Free and open-minded management, a lot of projects can choose.	Contractors cannot have some same benefits like medical care, family care as FTE, no bonus, no career improvement. Many contractors work even much better than FTEs but cannot be treated equally and someone will take it as granted and treated by bad attitude.

291	Broken Systems and Processes	 Escalation Specialist	7 Nov 2018	2.0	"Great Food
Free Cab Service
Timely Salary"	Almost all Internal Tools were broken and various process followed in my role and at work were highly inefficient. Making any attempts to fix these broken pieces or raising awareness about the situation wasn't perceived well. Most teams were perpetually understaffed across regions thereby taking away all flexibility around leaves and other perks. No serious attempts are made to hire on priority. Sr. Management is well aware of the areas to improve flagged repeatedly by the team but almost no changes are made. Performance evaluation random and highly driven by Management's perception of the person rather than basing it Impact  on the job. The HRBP and and other resource teams add zero value and encourage the team to keep their head down and keep working. The work pressure is endless and the poor management makes it worse. My only regret is not leaving this role sooner.
292	Great Company	 Account Manager	22 Oct 2018	5.0	Excellent Culture, exceptional colleagues and fun place to work.	No variable pay, operational work, and almost no work-life balance.

- things change quickly and sometimes comms fell through the cracks
- frequent performance cycle can be stressful"

Provide meals and snacks.
With the work environment, it is easy to learn alot"	"Strong issue with work life balance.
Pace is extremely fast, and changes happen to fast.
With less clarity on the job scope, it can get really overwhelming.
This is especially true with large organisation, and each one has their own agenda."

303	Contingent worker as a 2nd class citizen	 Business Integrity Analyst	13 Nov 2017	1.0	"Great company perks
Great company to have on your resume"	"Weak accountability amongst Full-time Staff
Full-time staff take credit for work of contingent workers
No recognition or KPIs for contingent staff
Easily used as a Scapegoat to cover up mistakes by Full-time staff"
304	Best company to work for	 Project Manager	20 Oct 2017	5.0	"This is one of the best company I worked for in my 25year career. Extremely employee focussed, great benefits and caring.

305	Negative culture in SG office	 Partner Manager	5 Oct 2017	2.0	Good benefits, flexible work hours, opportunity to help small businesses grow.	Bad management, aggressive infighting culture, unhappy suppressed employees. Politics slowly emerging in every organization.
306	Business Integrity Analyst	 Anonymous Contractor	20 Aug 2017	4.0	Flexible working hours. Productivity is not a KPI. Place for self-development and recuperation.	Upper management practices a eyes-on-hands-off approach in handling internal team issues. Lack of appreciation and action for team. HR is non-existent in the company.
307	"""Nothing is someone else's problem"""	 Anonymous Employee	24 Jul 2017	5.0	Smart collective of people. Able to move fast - shift anf lift. Agile community. Strong perks and amazing food. Best intend for clients and users.  High integrity. Freedom to do waht you want to do, and thrive on your strengths. Fair compensation.	Although a good work-life balance is stimulated, you tend to be always on (by choice).  Support has to be won - you need to have a selfstarter mentality.
308	Product Support Team - Disappointment	 Product Support Specialist	18 Jun 2017	1.0	"The pros are - 

- The overall company culture
- Good food

I did not find any pro in the product support team. 

I would recommend working at Facebook, but be very aware of which teams you join, the core responsibilities, the manager, the career level your are joining at etc."	"- It was a struggle to spend time in such a monotonous and mundane role. 
- I was sold this role to be a product role, but this is a pure Operations role. 
- Do not be fooled when asked / told about strong analytics required etc, you would most likely end up answer to angsty folks in sales teams and doing customer service.

Please spend your time in a core role, it is where you'd have value in Facebook. It is easy to feel rudderless in this role (no matter what is told to you during your interviews). Employees in non-support / core roles are valued in the company, unfortunately this team and its immediate umbrella organization is not one of them."
309	Regional Marketing Manager	 Regional Marketing Manager Singapore	24 May 2017	5.0	"- Great company to work with
- Huge learning opportunity
- Brand name for your resume
- Awesome management team and colleagues"	"- Politics is emerging slowly
- Difficult to choose between work and parties"
310	Business Integrity Analyst	 Business Integrity Analyst	10 May 2017	5.0	The best place to work at!	Work-life balance sort of goes for a toss.
311	Incredible place to be; not incredible place to grow	 Client Partner	17 Jan 2017	5.0	"* Culture there is positively amazing, and it believed and lived.  Consistent throughout offices around the world--a rarity.
* Benefits are world-class
* Mission driven--everyone believes in it
* Zuck is fantastic"	* At this point in the organization's life they are more inclined to hire managers from outside instead of promoting from within.  Many employees have been burned by violated expectations around this.  Therefore, no longer a great place to get new responsibilities quickly--you kind of just stay in place as the pyramid grows around you
312	Amazing Culture	 Partner Manager	11 Dec 2016	5.0	"Amazing company culture that's embedded in most of its employees. Feedback is done in the most constructive way possible. No BS, genuine attempt to minimize politics (yes no company is 100% politics free), super fast paced, yet respectful of individual time and space. Highly collaborative environment, and everything is measured by impact to people. 

Employees are committed to their works and committed to have fun as well! Most of us are unpretentious or trying to hard to impress or look busy, even though the work is very intense! That's why visitors always thought that we hardly work!

Be warned though, this company may not be for everybody, particularly if your strength revolves around internal politics and bootlicking, or you prefer companies where you can relax and do minimal work, or you don't like to have tough conversations to solve tough problems, or you don't like to work with a team where everybody knows what each other is doing."	Writing this just because I have to, though there's really no cons that I can think of. If I really have to think of something, perhaps it's the amount of interesting information that you have to keep up with everyday.
313	Partnerships Manager	 Anonymous Employee	3 Aug 2016	5.0	"Great culture. Generally more open and transparent than most organization. People take ownership of what they do and take pride in the impact they make.

Internal mobility among roles, teams and locations is great and there are programs that help with mobility."	As the company gets bigger, it is experiencing some growing pains as well such as increasing politics and decreasing transparency. A lot of industry hires simply do not understand the Facebook culture while holding key positions and decision making power
314	From the viewpoint of a contractor	 Contractor	14 Mar 2016	2.0	"Opportunities to communicate with clients who are experts in advertising on Facebook
Learning about Facebook advertising solutions from the basic to comprehensive level"	"Discrimination in treatment between full-time employee and contractor
Micro-management working environment applied on contractor"
315	Good place to learn but being a contractor leads you nowhere	 Client Service Associate	20 Nov 2015	3.0	Good opportunity to learn and to jump job	"The job gets repetitive, you drown in the boring tasks and cases without learning anything new

Being a contractor, you are replaceable. No personal growth and no clear career path. 

Don't think by doing a great job you will be considered to be hired as FTE. Better plan for your own future"
316	Great place to work	 Client Partner	2 Jun 2015	5.0	Great amount of autonomy given to employees at all levels. Leadership is very transparent. All employees are encouraged to never hesitate to question their leaders. Overall environment is one of cohesiveness and cogeniality	Targets & Goals set can be very aggressive. Hiring still tends to be slow which results in tough workloads on current employees.
317	Really Good to work for.	 Senior Recruiter	23 Jun 2013	5.0	Great management, great team, great environment	Not a whole lot really. Perm staff members do get treated a lot better than contractors.
