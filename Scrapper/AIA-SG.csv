7	How I lost money working 2 years at AIA	 Financial Services Consultant	15 Feb 2023	1.0	decent incentives/bonus (only if you do well)	"I had to pay back my ""Basic"" salary after 2 years because I did not hit this thing called persistency when my contract ended. It was really tough and I did not make the cut because some people cancelled their plans due to covid which affected my performance. As a result I made a total negative loss on my income for 2 years, and ended being in debt to the company despite working for them. Meanwhile other agents are producing ""fake cases"" and abusing a loophole in the system and getting away with it with loads of cash. And honest agents that don't do well suffer all the backlash. I wrote in to appeal and my case was rejected as well."

Flexible work hours

Progression path is transparent and accessible.

Self led, you are your own boss

Sales technology and it support are excellent"	"Effort and hours does not translate into Salary, due to its sales based pay scheme. No sales = no earnings. 
Work hours is flexible but be prepared to invest a significant chunk of time, beyond normal office hours into this. 
Not everyone is a high achiever, being able to successfully conduct sales is not as easy as your recruiter would like you to believe. 

People/Students considering joining as an agent, do take note of the contract maintenance requirements (sales quota) and persistency score. Having clients who decide to drop their plans purchased from you results in reduced persistency, and it can lead to clawbacks in comission or if you are in the EPS scheme. 
Appeals for the persistency strike might not be approved, despite the fact that your clients decision to do so is out of your control."
