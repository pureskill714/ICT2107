1	meh	 Account Health Specialist	26 Feb 2023	2.0	Good hiring and onboarding process	Micro management from mangers Unable to see purpose of certain tasks
2	Not bad	 Warehouse Associate	24 Feb 2023	3.0	Multi cultural and respectful senior management	Co workers can be toxic sometimes
3	Supercharged learning for early career	 Risk Manager	17 Feb 2023	5.0	- Learn from the leaders that enable you to grow by challenging your mental models and how you approach problems - You get a fair degree of flexibility in developing solutions for business problems that you identified as priority to work on	- As you progress upwards, politics will start becoming more obvious. Managers do a good job of shielding their functional roles from dealing with them directly, however this can be a risk if you are not well equipped to handle it as you go through promotions - Depending on the maturity of your country's business unit, even if you have flexibility in building solutions, you will have a fair bit of compliance to worry about with Global standards established in the NA region. This can be a dealbreaker for some people as certain business problems require customization for different regions, hence becoming a blocker instead of an enabler.

10	Better than most packing jobs	 Warehouse Packer	25 Jan 2023	3.0	Air conditioned warehouse with better welfare than other companies	Job nature still mundane and not recommended to do long term
11	Only worth your time if you have a good boss.	 Account Manager	20 Jan 2023	3.0	- Strong culture - Challenging work - Good Exposure	- If you have a bad boss, you will not be able to promote - Your team can become really toxic, if the hiring bar is lowered - Leadership keeps changing and they don't really know what they are doing.
12	Temporary Job	 Picker/Packer	14 Jan 2023	3.0	Simple and easy No need to socialise Easy to get shifts	Boring and long with the new requirement hours 10 hours is too long and the work load is somewhat unbalanced Forced to be doing anything and everything with every second of work

14	AWSome Company to work for!	 Senior Solutions Architect	3 Jan 2023	5.0	* Go-getter culture permeates the entire company * Extremely customer focused - you will learn to put the customer at the center of all our thought * Most leaders live by the Amazon Leadership Principles most of the time * Fun work culture	* Work can get to you if you do not prioritize and filter work * While technical eminence is part of your KPI - it usually comes at the cost of a lot of after work hour effort * Direct culture - be prepared to hear blunt feedback - but it is not meant in a negative way
15	Work life	 Associate Vendor Manager	2 Jan 2023	5.0	Very good work-lift balance, people are smart and friendly.	Too much ad-hoc and last min work request.
16	Great culture but a Lack of Manpower	 Internship	28 Dec 2022	4.0	A talented team and a great culture as expected in a tech company.	With a lack of manpower, I find many holding multiple roles and it could be overbearing at times. One has to know how to prioritize and find balance in work and play.
17	AVS/SVS/CATEGORY SPECIALIST (DO NOT APPLY) singapore	 Brand Specialist SVS	20 Dec 2022	1.0	able to learn about Amazon best practices from overseas	Worst job scope, do not apply. Multiple vendor managers who are unclear and do not take ownership of their own Brand/category. Convinced brand to pay for a head count in Amazon to focus on certain growth pillar however most VMs exploit the headcount to handle all task related to that vendor. Amazon has great success in the continental countries however they not able to localise (south east Asia) to local e-commerce landscape.

32	Can be great if you are okay with Contact Center environment	 Account Health Support Specialist	16 Oct 2022	4.0	Great people. Seriously, I met best managers and coworkers and leaders here. Everyone is willing to help you and sometimes your colleagues make it okay when you had a tough day at work.	It's like they need you to be always doing something. On top of your usual work handling tasks, you will get pressured to taking side projects if you wish to step upward. That can be expected but even if you drive yourself chances of getting promoted can be quite slim. Also, not enough perks/benefits. They do not have extra flexi benefits to spend and do not even have lucky draw at the end of the year or something. Even when they do site wide events the winner gets like $30 reward. No iphone 14 :)
33	Good company	 Senior Consultant	14 Oct 2022	3.0	Good brand .And improvement for your career.	Lower salary comparing with other FLAG companys

40	Great Culture and Benefit	 Community Marketing Manager	19 Sep 2022	5.0	The leadership principle culture is amazing and all leader really breathe and live with that. One of my favourite LP is disagree and commit. The benefit also amazing and very generous, it's weird feeling when other tech company is hiring freeze in 2022 and layoff but Amazon still hiring and thrive for growth.	Complicated system and not fluid with the process. Since Amazon already a huge company, there's WIKI and training for EVERYTHING. You will be overwhelmed with the number of training, workshop, and onboarding items on your embark. But in the end it will help you, but it's not for everyone. Amazon is a very peculiar company.
41	Research scientist intern	 Research Scientist	14 Sep 2022	5.0	It's a chill place to work and the problem scale is interesting. Would definitely explore full time opportunities here.	Very few cons but WFH makes it hard to make friends at work!

43	Grateful to join a great team	 Technical Program Manager II	5 Sep 2022	5.0	My manager values WLB a lot. Although I am working with my team members remotely all the time, it doesnt block my motivation to work hard and discuss / chat with my teammates because they are all very nice and friendly. I look forward to my future growth together with the team!	I do not have teammates located same as me so I work from home everyday. Not necessarily to go to office but still feel a little bit of physically disconnected.
44	Least attractive among Big Tech Companies	 Senior Financial Analyst	3 Sep 2022	3.0	Pay is decent, but no variable bonus	work life balance is the worst among FAANG, Highly recommend to join other companies in FAANG.

- Everyday is really Day 1, you will absorb every info there is in your first 3-6 months"	WFH is kinda default mode, for new joiner is a bit shocker when you came to office in your day 1 but nobody greet you or welcome you. You will need to do everything by yourself eg: setting up email, etc.

50	Fast Paced Environment, Great for Growth	 AWS Cloud Architect	29 Aug 2022	5.0	The environment is very fast paced, with fantastic learning opportunities since Day 1. Salary and compensation is good (RSUs etc), not to mention the strong brand name/prestige that comes from working at FAANG. You also get to work with highly intelligent people.	Work life balance leaves more to be desired, but that's due to being shorthanded in a high growth sector.
51	Good for cv	 Marketing Manager	24 Aug 2022	2.0	"great for cv

AWS promotion is very slow and the workload here is damn overwhelmingly big. Have to quickly adapt in this fast pace and stressful environment.
87	New Joiner Review	 Senior Cloud Architect	22 Mar 2022	5.0	The company lives and breathes by the Leadership Principles, they are not for show unlike other companies, and the culture is excellent. The focus on onboarding is the best I've seen in my 10+ years of working. Hierarchy is flat, the colleagues are excellent, there is a high level of psychological safety in terms of speaking up and making honest (non-deliberate) mistakes. All of their working principles are backed by scientific research you have probably read in articles (eg. Harvard Business Review, etc), but almost never followed in your current company ever - except Amazon. Technical wise, you working for the world's best Cloud Provider and have a ton of opportunities to learn.	"The culture is not for everyone. 

You have to be very disciplined, a self-starter, and manage your own time and career. In short, you must have a high degree of ownership. This is not a con if you have the right mindset and making very deliberate choices on what you want to focus on (job, experience, family, etc.)

Looking at what others have written negatively, especially about work-life balance, they are more of a bad fit rather than a con of working at Amazon. There are many avenues to seek help when you feel overwhelmed, but you have to own the decision."
88	Potentially confusing environment, but great colleagues	 Program Manager	21 Mar 2022	4.0	I love my coworkers and seniors. They are all very smart and give great feedback.	Environment of builder-culture can lead to lots of confusion and double-work.

98	Dislike	 DCEO Facility Engineer	27 Feb 2022	2.0	Good colleague,.working together and friendly team	Bad man management and senior management. Only focused on getting things done. If you do good, its expected. But if you do bad, they will scrutinized you badly
99	New-joiner review	 Global Account Manager	27 Feb 2022	5.0	The focus at on-boarding is second to none - learn about us, DEI, culture, peculiar things and critically the Leadership Principals. Time is allocated officially through a structured Embark Plan agreed with your direct manager. You literally will not be touching your new job until you are on-boarded and accredited and that is excellent.	The volume of on-boarding collateral is huge, and some on-boarding programs are repeats of each other. You have to be your own time-manager to ensure you do the tasks and become an efficient Amazonian - it's down to you as it is very self-serve environment in Amazon even more so now with Covid-19. But this is also a Pro.

110	Positive on-boarding	 Enterprise Deal Lead	30 Jan 2022	5.0	Really impressive digital/virtual on-boarding experience despite almost all WFH. A tsunami of info but well presented and managed in my first couple of months. Strong program to shadow peers to get up to speed as quickly as possible.	Many tools and systems are available and trying to understand where to go to for info can take time and coaching/ learning much through experience.

- Choice of laptops
- WFH equipment compensation
- Mobile/bill compensation
-AWS exams compensation
- Flexible working hours"	"- Be prepared for information overload during onboarding period

116	Technician	 Technician	17 Jan 2022	3.0	"Good Amazon feedback
Bonus was nice
Social place"	There is a 5 word minimum
117	Great place to work in	 Principal Product Manager	16 Jan 2022	5.0	Even though Amazon has got some negative press, its actually a great place to work in. The work you do is meaningful and has immediate impact to large communities. It's usually bar raising work and can be meaningful to your career especially in cloud and tech.	It can be quite taxing. The pace of growth is very fast, so everyone needs to learn to sometimes take a break.
118	Everything is Good	 Account Specialist	14 Jan 2022	5.0	Everything is Good : )	so far so good : )
119	Good company	 Associate	11 Jan 2022	3.0	Best resource.people are nice,after gaining experience can become a team leader.	Too many hours have to Walk
120	AWS Singapore	 Solutions Architect	7 Jan 2022	5.0	Great place to work, a lot of learning opportunities been provided to grow and continuously development. People are willing to share and help each other all the time.	There are so many things to learn, but this is also an advantage if you enjoy the continuous self-improvement
121	This particular role is not for the Faint Hearted	 Account Specialist	31 Dec 2021	3.0	"-Health Benefits are above average
-High pay for the role above market rate
-Proper training is in place with a lot of meterial to learn from and seniors to learn from, training is 4 weeks theory and 2 weeks hands on and relatively a steep curve.
- A bit about the role, timing is 830 - 530, officially need to be operational 900 to 500 on a 5day rotational schedule. If your schedule falls on weekends or PH you still need to work, as per norm, you will be credited 1 day extra leave for PH
-for Chinese Specialist, make sure your Chinese language speaking, reading and writing really is proficient or it will be challenging on top of the steep learning curve.
- Amazon's culture is Everyday Is Day 1 and this is very true as there are every changing sops and procedures.
- Be prepared for a rollercoaster ride
- If you want a relax job or you are the type that needs time to think properly or is slower at doing work and CANNOT MULTITASK, this role is definately not for you!!!
- it is not a normal call center role where you just need to reply to customer enquiries, part of the role is to investigate cases as well. You do learn alot but at the same time depending on an individual's mindset it is not for the weak hearted as it is quite overwhelming once you are on the 'operating floor'"	"-This particular role is extremely intense due to the call centre nature. 
-The timing is stringent and no leeway to relax at all except during the 2x15min break window and lunch time
-You have to log in and out and be accountable for every minute that you are 'working' 
- be prepared to sit your butt down without moving unless you are on break or lunch."

124	Not too bad	 Program Manager	22 Dec 2021	4.0	- Tons of exposure to different domain/subjects	"- Competitive environment
- Social Hierachy"
125	You cannot go wrong being obsessed over the customer	 Solutions Architect	22 Dec 2021	4.0	The company puts customer first in everything. Giving the customer the greatest value is the obsession of its leaders. Always do what's best for the customer, preferring long term wins over short term gains. Invent and simplify for the customer's sake.	Too many independent teams making independent decisions can sometimes result in inconsistency. Being over focussed on the leader principles can become too inward looking.
126	Great so far	 Anonymous Employee	21 Dec 2021	4.0	"- The Onboarding plan is structured and trains each new hire in the Amazonian ways. 
- Successful company that is always looking to innovate. It’s still Day 1.

- Approvals can be slow since it is a huge organisation"
132	Complete opposite of reviews here	 Recruiter	7 Dec 2021	5.0	Right from the first touch point of applying for the role and going through the interview process, it has been nothing but amazing. Contrary to the negative and bad reviews from others, it is totally not what I’ve experienced. Amazon is huge with lots of different entities and businesses, it’s not fair to generalise bad experiences across different teams and businesses.	No swag on day 1, lots of training videos and materials, many different platforms to navigate. Benefits not as competitive compared to the other tech giants.
133	Strong and clear culture	 Intern	2 Dec 2021	5.0	Big fan of the leadership principles - they do what they preach. A high-performing team that is nurturing and will actively seek opportunities to give me learning and visibility. Certifications are claimable and that's great for skills advancement. Very clear career progressions too.	Work-life balance is something that they are working on - but someone with ownership is unlikely to switch off and truly embrace work-life balance. Not an environment for everyone - suits ambitious people more
134	Startup vibe and thinking long-term	 Specialist	1 Dec 2021	5.0	Flexible and Innovative, rooms for discussion and experiment. This is much needed when dealing with new tech.	Dynamic and productivity systems are not integrated

142	Can be busy, but work is very focused	 Solution Architect	8 Nov 2021	5.0	Plenty of learning and upskilling opportunities. Get all the AWS certifications if you like. Colleagues are generally helpful and friendly and you can get mentorships. Internal transfers can be requested for. Fully work from home during COVID.	Work can be rather busy at times, especially during the first 3 months of onboarding. Knowing how to prioritize and guard your time is important.
143	Great	 Principal Product Manager	1 Nov 2021	5.0	Good ownership. Strong product development process. Lots of opportunities for growth.	Company culture is diluting with scale. Many leaders now clearly no longer customer obsessed or passionate about building. More focused on building career milestones and associated politics.

194	Think twice before joining	 Account Health Support Specialist	29 May 2021	1.0	Not much OT, salary is paid on time	"This role is essentially a call centre role that is disguised as a ""specialist"" role. No part of the job description says that it is a call centre role. The culture here is as toxic as hell. You will be on your chair from 830-530 with only 2 x 15 mins break + 1h lunch break. If you exceed your break by even 1 minute, you're expected to explain why to your manager. Personal time aka toilet time is capped at 20 minutes a week. If you do the math, that is 4 min/day you're allowed to step away from your workstation to visit the toilet/answer phone calls. Is this even humane? 

The job itself is pretty redundant and full of lies. You're expected to lie to the sellers you're talking to on the phone that you have 0 visibility on the situation. In actual fact, there is 100% visibility just that you are not allowed to share any info with the seller. If you're caught sharing, you will be in what they call ""The Sharing Box"" which is basically a sabo box where specialists sabo each other so that they get recognised. 

The turnover rate is super high which says a lot about the organisation, hence they are mass hiring just to replace those that have left. There is also little to no career progression. They are intending to hire a lot of specialists in the thereabouts of 300 so you'd need to compete with 300 other specialists for promotion."
195	Bad Management, Silo working style, Poor Visibility	 Anonymous Employee	28 May 2021	2.0	"1. Some of the most brilliant people I have worked with. 

2. Diverse culture

3. Fast paced and agile"	"1. Very bad regional leadership in APAC SPA, which uses performance improvement program as a tool to rid off team members whom they dislike and are prejudiced against. Using misconstrued data to support their unjust cause and gaslight employees into resignations. 

2. No oversight from the leadership from CTPS organisation on point 1, global teams work in silo which discourages teamwork and collaboration - teams are at the mercy of regional leadership management with minimal supervision. 

3. Salary packages are not competitive compared to other Tech firms, there is a ceiling cap on salary for different levels (increments are negligible e.g. $8 per annum)."

Great facilities"	"AHS - This is basically a call centre role which requires you to be on call from the start till the end of your shift. Job description is misleading which explains the high turnover rate and mass hire that is still ongoing since the start of the department in SIN. Work done here does not feel meaningful and impactful at all as it could've been easily covered by the other teams through restructuring. The management does not (and will not) care about the duration of your stay - headcount is simply replaced through new hires daily that are clueless and farewells are like bread and butter in this team. 

Bias and favouritism from team leads/managers are so prevalent that they are not even discreet about it. Career progression is not judged by the hard work you've done but rather on the hands of management which are all highly uncoordinated and probably not even sure of the groundworks done by the ""specialists"". This breeds a cult-like and toxic environment as everyone struggles to get themselves on the good books of the managers in order to advance in the position. Hardworking individuals are all leaving one by one as the working environment is so depressing and there's practically zero opportunity to progress if you do not butter up to anyone. 

Feedback system is in practice for the sake of it - mostly patronised and no feasible action done no matter how many times it was highlighted. Unnecessary meetings called for on a daily basis that discuss meaningless topics. Be ready for top-down management style and micromanaged while in this team. 

I feel the company itself is a great place to work at, just not in AHS. If a call centre job is what you're looking for, would still suggest you to look elsewhere with better management that actually cares for your well-being and career interest, do not get enticed by the company brand name. Considering a call centre role is already stressful enough, it is just not worth it to be here dealing with all these politics and compromise on your mental health."

265	Bar raised too high and subpar review session	 Data Center Technician Trainee	21 Oct 2020	1.0	Good benefits, good pay. Snacks in pantry is above average	"As titled, the bar had been raised too high, to the point I don't think the people inside AWS Singapore even know what they are looking for.

I can tell you how much I know about AWS AZ inner workings, the layout of the data center, the myriad of hosts AWS have and etc but I am still not being accepted on a pretense that I did not do enough complex tasks, screwed up my 2nd review and etc. I can tell by the expression that I was truly appreciated during my time there but internal politics prevail over everything.

The entire so-called ""review"" section is a sham. Anything you said will get a kneejerk reaction to get stomped over, Review session is hold just for the sake to belittle you. What is the point of asking about ""Your strongest point"" and the response you get is demoralization? Like why does AWS even have such review system? It does not motivate the trainee, and it is extremely demoralizing as a result.

upon being told I wasn't accepted, I was somewhat relief because favoritism plays too much in the office politics and I am glad I am not going to be part of it.

So I hope this review allows people to stays clear of this so called ""Trainee program"". It is not worth it to get insulted. Never know insulting is part of the 14 leadership principles. My advice is to get your ""traineeship"" somewhere and join AWS as a full time data center technician because AWS Singapore does not know how to train people at all. Plus with all the COVID-19 complications, these training is meaningless because you are stuck at 1 site all this time."

Everyone, and I mean everyone, has been amazing to work with - super nice and genuine, and very efficient with their work (save for 1 or 2). No regrets signing on this contract role.	The teams are all rather niche, which makes finding information tough as you have to go around the teams fishing for stuff.

271	Terrible culture	 Anonymous Employee	5 Oct 2020	1.0	Decent pay and fairly open to relocation but only after getting promoted.	No work life balance. Top management is very pushy and has unrealistic goals, constantly have to answer unreasonable questions. Very very long working hours and company is unwilling to expand the team due to its 'lean' culture. People are very individualistic and they have a wiki culture so you are expected to read the wikis before actually asking someone which sometimes isn't even helpful at all due to bad writing. Required to do both strategy and manual work which realistically, is quite difficult to balance hence the long hours.

- Favouritism occurs a lot.
- There are unrealistic demands for rates, which is rather discriminatory against older employees as they lack the energy and speed that younger employees have to complete a task.
- Lots of unmotivated workers who are here only for the pay and do not care about the processes or the bigger picture of working at Amazon that much."

Managers who get poor scores in connections do org restructures to try and hide their ineptitude

Pay is abysmal. Be warned they suck you in with shares but because of the shares performance you get no salary increase

No interest in development

Really inward looking, little interest in developing collaborative relationship with suppliers

307	New hires since 2017-2019 are entitled millennials	 Anonymous Employee	24 Dec 2019	2.0	Some of the people you meet can be nice and helpful - these are typically the people who have been working for longer than 5 to 10 years in their careers (overall), and know what they can contribute to the company and how best to fit in the team. The management style is also very western - as long as you can finish your work, you do not need to conform to the standard office hours. Work-life balance is encouraged and benefits are on-par with larger Singapore MNCs.	"Newer, younger hires are entitled and feel they should be taken care of by management, instead of helping themselves. They constantly berate management and think the world of themselves, even though they do not contribute much to the company. 

In the Singapore office, the younger generation are egoistic and enjoy playing politics, even within their own teams. They would exaggerate their contributions and be awesome at reporting upwards to management. I have a colleague who loves asking the same 'deep' questions whenever management visits from Seattle just to ensure her presence is noted. Unfortunately, the current interview process is created to hire these types of ""me-first"" and ""everyone-else-but-me-is-to-blame"" employees. 

Senior management is also partial to ignoring cultural problems, as they are under tremendous pressure to meet KPIs. They pay lip service to ground employees but turn around and pass the problem to someone else, until the problem is buried under a stack of other problems."
308	Awesome culture	 Territory Sales Representative	22 Dec 2019	5.0	lots of opportunities for learning and building. Great place for trying new ideas, surrounded by smartest people, excellence teamwork experience.	staff benefits seems not updated.
309	Great place to learn and make an impact (even as an intern)	 Intern	7 Dec 2019	5.0	This is one of the less common companies where the employees constantly demonstrates the 14 leadership principles in their work. People here work really hard, and are really proud of the work they do, creating a generally motivating and driven environment. Things might get a little intense sometimes, especially at the start where there is a steep learning curve and you have to get up to speed immediately, but the vast amount of resources readily available and open environment makes rolling in the sand a lot easier. There are also a lot of learning opportunities for non-tech people to pick up certifications and learn about cloud products and services.	During my batch, there was no structured conversion program in place so conversion was rare and difficult. Especially given their high hiring bar, it often makes more sense to the business to hire applicants who have 3-4 years of experience for the same entry level role. That said, the student program team has made a conscious effort to change that, and there will be a more structured conversion program starting next year, so definitely better luck on securing a spot in the company after your internship!

- opportunity to move around internally within different orgs
-"	"- amazon operates based on more of a ""self-service"" model, no spoon feeding from managers and peers, this will sometimes create difficulties to cop especially for new joiners"
319	Horrible work culture that places perception over everything else	 Anonymous Employee	23 Aug 2019	1.0	"- Good salary package
- Good brand-name
- Being part of a new and growing field in Tech"	"- Work culture is heavily diluted from the ideals set forth by Amazon, culture is no longer about placing Customers first (as per Amazon's 1st Leadership Principle of Customer Obsession) as it has now turned into deliver results (revenue) above all else even if it means acting in the disbenefit of customers. 

- Work culture has a heavy slant towards office politics, no longer can you just focus on doing what you do best but you have to play the office politics game of winning favors from others including your managers and ""appearing"" to be a ""good employee"", in short, actual competency comes secondary to the appearance of it

- Heavy focus on meeting numbers and revenue, AWS now feels as though its another of those Day 2 companies (e.g Oracle) that has stopped trying to do what is right but rather desperately trying to cling onto the status quo 

- Managers run their departments like their own personal fiefdoms, little to no accountability seen from their decisions taken (at least from the ground) and an employee's experience can vary drastically from one manager to another which indicates a dilution of organization culture, turning the organization into silos of disparate culture that stems from the managers. 

- Managers seems to be far more interested in short-term results in order for them to report up and for themselves to look good to higher management, I don't think that they are acting in the interest of the long-term goals of the company or their employees.

- Highly transactional environment where an individual isn't appreciated as a person but looked at as just another number on the paper,.

- Having said the above, an employee's experience varies greatly depending on your manager, if you happen to get a good and supportive manager, then you'll likely enjoy your work and being in AWS but if you don't then you'll hate it, which is why there is such high turn-over and super short tenure in certain departments over another.

- Lack of co-operation between the different departments within the organization as all of them have very different KPIs and agendas that doesn't necessarily tie into a unified goal, hence you find departments actively pushing back when you're seeking assistance in something that doesn't contribute to their KPI.

- Too much of a shout-out, kudos and rara-ing culture, its all about visibility and self-promotion within the organization and its honestly nauseating."

328	Initial assessment of Amazon	 Technical Program Manager	16 Dec 2018	5.0	Great leadership principles, smooth interview and on boarding process. Customer centric. Good health care benefits.	Not having the best compensation package, I believe  frugality is the reason.
329	Not for everyone, but ideal for some.	 Anonymous Employee	18 Nov 2018	5.0	Autonomy, responsibility, working with the best. Always focus on the customer.	High bar = high stress. No one gets away with mediocrity.
330	Great culture but low compensation	 Senior Consultant	10 Nov 2018	4.0	Brightest people, very strong culture	Compensation is boring! Promotion process too rigid.
331	AWSome place to work	 Program Manager	29 Oct 2018	5.0	"- Smart and motivated co-workers.
- A lot of opportunities."	"- Fast-paced work environment (it could be ""cons"" for some people)."
332	Low in work culture	 Marketing Manager	26 Sep 2018	4.0	Colleagues are usually talented, you will get to learn a lot. Mostly not stingy with travels even for non sales positions. However, only economy flights even for frequent flyers. The company is growing rapidly, a lot of opportunities for career growth.	No attractive bonus for career progression. Everyone has more that what they can handle on their plate and no one is free to hand hold you. You have to figure out yourself.
333	DCEO	 DCEO	12 Sep 2018	5.0	"Opportunities for Advancement

Fast pace company"
334	Business Development Manager	 Anonymous Employee	3 Sep 2018	5.0	The leadership principals sets the cornerstone for everyone’s alignment especially during critical decision making time.	Organisation is very flat.
335	Great company to work in!	 Anonymous Intern	17 Aug 2018	4.0	"Amazon is an amazing company with a rich culture and leadership principles that are practiced throughout the company. People there are very professional and good at their job and are committed to their work. Most employees have the distinct characteristic of constantly looking to improve and innovate their processes, products & services. Company's compensation and benefits are above market's average. 

Singapore's office consist of employees from diverse countries and it is a good experience working with people from different cultures.

Learning and development programs are very thorough, where employees are free to take up extra trainings in their own time to upgrade their skills.

Good employee welfare with bonding/celebration once in a while and pantry is always stocked with basic food supplies e.g. biscuits, milo, coffee, cold drinks, bread."	Everybody in Amazon is very busy as a lot is expected from a single headcount. Most people are likely to work overtime to finish their work. However, if you are able to be more efficient and plan your time accordingly, you are not expected to work OT.
336	Very fast paced working environment with high stress loading	 Security Operation Center Technician	2 Aug 2018	3.0	Very innovative, a lot of new high technology tools, very efficient company working culture	extremely high pressure working environment. pushy style management culture
337	Fast paced and highly innovative company to work for.	 Marketing	11 Jul 2018	5.0	"Good benefits
Great open working culture"	"High Expectations 
Potentially Long working hours"
338	One of the best places	 Program Manager II	17 Mar 2018	4.0	"1. Generally talented colleagues with drive to achieve more
2. Very challenging program and very unique problems for you to solve. If you solve it, you will create huge impact worldwide.
3. Data driven culture with availability of data. The level of analysis is extremely thorough and even for program management, you find yourself spending significant amount of times getting and analyzing data for decision making."	"1. Too stringent on flight policy because for long haul, all you get is economy. Sometimes even premium economy is cheaper but you just cannot get it.
2. Very often Amazonians in Seattle expect/request colleagues in Asia to meet them in their Seattle friendly hours. This is inconsiderate. Imagine you have to start meeting them at 5 or 6am in the morning on weekly basis and it is few times a week.
3. There isn’t “perks” for Singapore, not even discount code for amazon.com purchase or amazon products. This is extremely strange."
339	AWS: A life time opportunity	 Big Data Analytics Consultant	16 Feb 2018	4.0	"Think big: with nearly unlimited cloud power with 120+ services, the sky is the limit in what we can achieve for our customers. Management pushes everyone hard to think much bigger to move the needle more effectively for our customers.
Our 14 leadership principles provide good guide in daily decision making process, with large autonomy left to each individual."	The fun part could be increased further, as it has been in recent years. We could share more about what we do on social media, when we have fun.
340	Awesome Tech Company!	 Data Center Technician	19 Sep 2017	5.0	"Started with Amazon about a month ago. So far my journey has been excellent and the support that I get from my managers help to boost my confidence. 

Excellent place for someone who aspires to know more about cloud computing.

Tons of excellent material that you can get your hands on and the only thing you need is time to grasp all the material.

I see myself working here for a very long time."	Not new to the data center industry. The tools that they use is a little non standard. So there is a slightly steep learning curve before you can be proficient with the work flow. Not a major issue at all just need to adapt and you will be fine.
341	Amazing place to work	 Anonymous Employee	3 Jul 2017	5.0	"- Good business
- Very strong in culture and values
- always pioneering to improve process and doing what is right"	- Flat structure, it might be a little hard to see career progression upwards but there are plenty of opportunity for lateral moves and expansion of role
342	Challenging, Supportive, and Rewarding	 Senior Cloud Architect	28 Jun 2017	5.0	"* Great support from management, co-workers, other teams
* Independence is encouraged and celebrated
* Solving hard problems with smart people
* Strong generative culture"	"* Not a ton of structure, and it's not always clear what tools and processes exist
* Not a lot of hand-holding.  Everyone's busy, and it's up to you to figure it out."
343	Hard driving culture but with potential to go far	 Consultant	25 May 2017	4.0	Very good investment into employees in terms of training and support. Plenty of opportunities to succeed and to have that success acknowledged, often at a global level. Strong corporate culture focused on customer, they walk the talk.	Economy flying even if you're a regular traveler for work. Work-life balance can be tough at times. Demanding culture, this isn't a place for sitting around. Self-service culture wastes your time doing admin tasks that could be easily offloaded. Due to fast hiring and turnover, hard to get veteran advice at times.
344	Account Executive Intern	 Account Executive Intern	27 Dec 2016	4.0	I was entrusted to communicate with the clients like other full timer employees. There is monthly team outing and we had lots of fun, e.g. bubble soccer and archery tag.	Amazon internship may not be the right program for people need instructions and guidance.
345	Good place to start off career	 Marketing Intern	15 Dec 2016	5.0	Good learning curve. You meet people who have years of experience and are not snobbish or stuck up. Got to travel altho this was an internship position, and made many new friends	no work life balance. female boss is very accomodating to higher ups and does not push back on requests, even if it comes at very late notice. No strategic plan at all.
346	Mismanaged team, over 80% attrition (isolated case). Otherwise a great company overall	 Anonymous Employee	26 Oct 2016	3.0	"- Opportunity to work on cool projects and initiatives with brilliant people all over the world
- Plenty of opportunity for lateral move to other business units (see cons)
- Strong work culture (read: Amazon Leadership Principles) means you can expect quality customer-obsessed works and ideas being worked on really quickly."	"The issue seems to be an isolated case within this specific team, primarily due to mismanagement: 
- Lack of vision as a team
- Poor understanding of the business in the region
- Tragic loss: over 80% attrition rate due to poor people management (a number of us moved laterally to other business units)"
347	Fast-pace, smart people, fun workplace, excellent growth	 Solutions Architect	24 Dec 2015	4.0	You'll work with great people and learn a lot. You will be expected to hold yourself to high standards. The company is large and you can move about/change your role to keep challenging yourself (but when you get into a role, you are expected to stay in it for 1-2 years before moving again). The company is a market leader and the quality of most functions is really high. Despite lots of work and the fast pace, there are enough get togethers/parties/celebrations.	"You need to work smart to keep up with the fast pace; you need to be able to identify what is important and what is not, and drop the not so important stuff -- and be prepared to justify your decision. Most managers will understand if you made a mistake as long as you thought about it rationally first.

Your career is in your hands -- most everyone is too busy to do more than give you high-level advice. If you keep your head down and become excellent at your level, you will remain a highly appreciated employee at your level. To be promoted, you need to try and get involved in things that give higher ups a chance to see your work.

Salaries are not the highest, though they are not bad either. You could get more elsewhere (but the workplace and colleagues may not be as great as here)."
348	Business Development and more	 Business Development	1 Aug 2015	4.0	Amazon has the brightest and most passionate people you'll ever work with in the technology industry. You'll work very hard and enjoy every bit of it somehow. You'll learn to drink from a firehose and life will never be the same again.	My theory is the human resource system in Amazon is designed to burn you out hence your RSUs are meant to keep you as long as possible by dangling a huge carrot for every additional year past the burned out phase (2 years). Its tough working for this company and you'll come out loving it or hating it.
349	Lack of career development, top-heavy, unappreciated	 Anonymous Employee	28 Jul 2014	2.0	"You will meet some of the brightest people here who are genuinely interested in technology and getting things done.

Truly a place where some of the cutting edge technologies are being developed every day."	"Zero career development. No career development discussions. When you do request for one, they turn it around and ask you to map out what you want. When you do, they don't respond or critique on your plan, or it will be something along the lines of ""I know you want... but at the moment that is not possible"". Either way, your voice is never heard.

Failure to deliver on promises. You're always given new roles and additional responsibilities with the promise that you'll eventually be promoted, but it never happens.

Compensation is a joke. Due to the sign-on bonuses and how they're structured, you will actually end up earning less after 2 years.

Lack of recognition. I have seen many projects taken away from the local teams and become ""globalised"", with no recognition given to the pioneers of the projects.

Yearly increments are non-existent or very small (< 5%).

Amazon Leadership Principles. These principles are good in theory, but in practise they're used against you. You'd be faulted if you spent more than necessary on a campaign for not being ""Frugal"", because you wanted to be ""Customer Obsessed"". You'd be faulted for not ""Having Backbone"" if you said yes to take on an additional job role, yet you'd also be faulted for not having ""Ownership"" and not thinking of the entire company if you said no. Most of the senior management do not ""Dive Deep"" and roll up their sleeves. When they do, it'd be a big thing and you'd see emails being sent all over the place.

Vested shares. It looks good on paper, but you only get all of it after 4 years. Also, they use it year after year during your yearly review to convince you why you are getting a good deal.

No teamwork, no camaraderie. I remember one of the senior management once mentioning he doesn't believe in friends within the workplace because it leads to employees not wanting to perform and outdo one another.

No alignment throughout the organization. Working with the corporate team is difficult, the goals are just not aligned and management does not help to make things easier. Most of the time you feel like your managers are against you just to please corporate, instead of backing you in getting things done."
350	Unappreciated, Overworked	 Datacenter Technician	24 Jul 2014	2.0	"- Great place to learn new technologies. 
- Team was close, and banded together against unrealistic expectations
- Generous starting pay package"	"- Zero professional growth. 
- Expected to always take on more roles and responsibilities, but without a pay increase.
- Bar raiser promotion system is a joke ( why would anyone work for you if they are better than 75% of the people there?)"
351	Be prepare to give up your work-life-balance if you join	 Sales Representative	1 Jan 2014	2.0	"You got to learn the best technology from them
A lot of smart people inside the organization
Huge office space, keep expanding and good to have its name on your CV
Got free flow of beer in the office."	"There is literally no work life balance inside this company.  Your boss would send you last min notice and ask you to fill some funny report and get back to him in a few hours or so
But it never works on the reverse, people here don't reply to your email unless they report to you
The senior management here are as arrogant as you can imagine.  Especially the most senior one in this office.  everyone in the team is considered stupid and not good enough."
