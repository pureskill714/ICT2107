-Transparency and candour of leaders: Sometimes companies have to make tough decisions, but HubSpot leadership generally does a great job of making decisions quickly and explaining the rationale with minimal corp speak
-Culture/People: It's nice to work with people are genuinely kind, empathetic, and eager to help.
-Diversity & Inclusion: Lots of tech companies just focus on increasing % of people from under-represented groups without considering whether the work environment is inclusive; HubSpot prioritizes both"	"-Not company's fault, but recent macroeconomic uncertainty contributes to volatility in forecasts and frequent need adjust focus
-Years of hyper growth have resulted in some processes being immature for a company of this size (goal-setting, performance reviews, promotion)"

19	Definitely a great place to work	 Support Specialist	17 Jun 2021	5.0	Great benefits, culture and people	The product is very broad and changes happen rapidly so support specialists have to manage knowledge across a large range of topics. If you're looking to apply, be prepared to spend a lot of time learning and upskilling outside of your work hours if you don't have a good foundation in technology/coding/inbound marketing
20	Great benefits and autonomy	 Anonymous Employee	5 May 2021	5.0	Great culture of openness and coaching, great benefits, lots of opportunities to learn	Slightly disadvantageous working in the Singapore office as opportunities are greater for NAM/EMEA employees to come to Asia as compared to the other way around.

30	Life changing company	 Senior Director, Strategic Partnerships	22 Jul 2020	5.0	"The ultimate perk is who you get to work with. My colleagues at HubSpot are on a different level of aptitude while maintaining incredible humility, transparency and helpfulness. I honestly have never and probably will never work with better people. 

At the same time the business is still in a serious growth phase and as long as you can keep adding value your career will grow at a rapid rate and give you learnings and experience that will open up opportunities for the rest of your career."	One thing is i would love to see us do more for non-profits. I have seen a lot of other companies have comprehensive non-profit programs, let's do one.
31	A HEART Company	 Executive Assistant	12 May 2020	5.0	A Company with Good Culture Code	I have no comments on this.
32	Proud to work at SingSpot	 Account Executive	12 Feb 2020	5.0	"I feel extremely lucky to have been able to call HubSpot home for the past several years. I believe our senior leadership team has done a tremendous job of listening to our customers, employees and investors and as a result has hit the mark in getting our product roadmap and go to market strategy right. Our financials, online reviews, ENPS and customer NPS scores are objective proof of this.

It's incredibly rare in a several thousand person company to be able to work this autonomously and see the tangible impact you can make as 1 employee. This is even more evident in our developing and emerging market groups such as Southeast Asia, India and Japan. 

I believe that every employee is trusted and encouraged by leadership to drive strategic initiatives which can impact the company's growth, our customer's experience and the community's adoption of best in class marketing/sales/customer service strategies.

I'm surrounded by some of the most intelligent, driven, and creative people I've ever had the pleasure of working with. This team constantly pushes me to level up my knowledge and skills, and hold myself to a higher standard. 

Very confident in our product and the people we have in place. Excited to see what lies ahead and grateful to be a part of the journey."	It can be easy to lose sight of how special it is be be a part of what we're building. Negativity amongst a few outliers, especially in satellite offices, can easily spread itself across teams and manifest itself as resentment. I believe it is on all of us to buck this trend.
33	Unparalleled Medical Benefits in Singapore but HR is a Disgrace	 Anonymous Employee	8 Feb 2020	2.0	"HubSpot has one of the best medical plans, which does not require a health screening to be eligible. Meaning pre-existing conditions and illnesses are covered too. Dependents not only includes spouses and children, but you can also add your girlfriend/boyfriend or partner onto your medical plan with the same exact coverage too.

Majority of my colleagues are wonderful people and many of us have formed great friendships due to the culture of the office. We have team-bonding outings and activities, some sponsored by the company and some by our manager/team budget. 

We have a well stocked pantry with snacks, ice cream, fruits, drinks, cold brew coffee, cold brew tea and even beer - all for free! Not to mention a free weekly lunch  on Thursdays for the whole office, which sometimes doesn't feed enough of us, but it is free so can't complain.

We have a prayer room for our muslim colleague, we have a mother's room, a meditation room which we all use as a nap room, and we have a fully equipped gym.

Having unlimited leave is communicated verbally, but it is not in our contract, as this is only applicable for top performers and if your workload is manageable in your absence. Our contract states 18 days annual leave, which is still pretty good if you add in all the public holidays."	"HubSpot proclaims to be a company with HEART but that is not the case, which is a let-down as I was led to believe otherwise. Employees and Managers are not treated equally or held to the same professional standards. There is also a bias between local and foreign employees.

Managers who should be on our UGJ (HubSpot's Use Good Judgement Policy) plan due to their insensitive unethical behavior, comments and action - do not, but instead wins a trip to our annual President's Club and not because of hard work but due to riding on the coattails of the team. 

Many complains have been made from various people to HR but our HRBP does nothing. There is no consequence to bad behavior and it is made to seem like we are sensitive and should not finger point, and instead we should be the ones to reflect on our own behavior and not nit-pick. When HRBP follows up, it is just a formality, to document, and it is a waste of our time as our feedback gets brushed under the rug, because HRBP has more important things to do. HRBP is hardly in the office, we all wonder what our HRBP actually does. 

HR is suppose to play a big role in mitigating conflicts. Conversations with HR are expressed as confidential but that is not the case, whatever feedback you've shared gets passed onto your manager. There is no trust and no psychological safety whatsoever. When you try to set up time to talk with HRBP, it either gets rescheduled because HRBP out of office or never happens at all because it gets forgotten and you are left hanging wondering, ""What is the point?"". Our HRBP tends to get emotional and has expressed that receiving personal feedback is not a strong suit. How then are we supposed to communicate to our HRBP if there are certain things we are unhappy with HR on?

Just a few days ago, I saw someone left a feedback on Glassdoor titled ""Shady practice being rewarded"". Our HRBP should have flagged that AE to management and put that AE on our UGJ plan but did not, if that AE was on the UGJ plan, promotion would not have been triggered and people will not be angrier at this outright scam. Now the whole Singapore office is talking about it, even though no names were mentioned, we know who it is and it is driving morale down.

If our HRBP claims to not know about this issue with that AE (which has been happening over an extended period of time and isn't a one -off case), it can be believable, because our HRBP does not bother to build relationships with employees or help resolve internal conflicts, but instead panders only to senior leadership."
34	One of the Best Places to Work - Culture of Growth and Quality of the People is Unparalleled	 Anonymous Employee	7 Nov 2019	5.0	"SingSpot is easily the best company I've worked for! 

First up, let's talk about the perks at SingSpot! Many of these reviews say they're unreal but let me break it down a little. It's a 'known fact' that Singapore's national pastime is eating - SingSpot delivers above and beyond on that front. Here's a list of what's in the mix: Waffle Wednesday, Catered Thursday Lunches, (newly-introduced) Panini Friday, End-Of-Month (EOM) Pizza and EOM Drinks. Not forgetting the amazing and well-stocked pantry - coconut water, green tea, ice creams, assorted nut dispensers, regional tidbits and 2 beer taps. 

If you think we're all about food and drinks, we have got in place an on-site gym and an annual gym subsidy for folks to balance the sinful indulgence. It does seem apt that I mention a little about our focus on Health and Wellness, especially after all that speak about eating and drinking. What we got at SingSpot is an insanely good medical and insurance coverage! It even covers visits at the Chiropractor and TCM specialist. What's more, we've even held massage sessions at SingSpot during our Health and Wellness Week. 

We are also a rather fun-loving and diverse bunch! Fun fact, we have more than 20 nationalities in the APAC region and that really brings on different perspectives. We also get together frequently as small groups and a couple of times every month and every quarter in big groups. Some cool gigs we've hit up in the past- Virtual Reality Park, LaserTag and Fragment Room. We have various interest groups ranging from the cat-lovers group to school alumni groups and women groups to a ping-pong club. 

It would be an absolute crime to not mention the unlimited vacation program and the flexibility to work from home. I love how the company recognizes how everyone may be wired differently - working remotely may help one to deliver their best work. To appreciate longer-tenured employees, HubSpot also offers a five-year sabbatical program which is a 4-week paid sabbatical with a $5k bonus! For those who may be interested, we do provide Employee Stock Purchase and Grants along with the employment. I do also think that we're quite competitively compensated at SingSpot. 

I also adore the work-life balance here - leaving work on time means I get to pursue my other passions/interests outside of work which value-adds to my work.

Now on to the 'more important' perks! HubSpot values personal development and growth of every single employee. The culture of growth and learning is seen in so much that we do - monthly new hire panel, new hire training program, workshops, AMAs, Specialized Training, Company Wiki and our Internal Online Learning Center. The leadership here is extremely transparent - we even have access to the decks/documents from their off-sites. The extremely feedback-centric culture might feel a little uncomfortable at the start but soon enough, you'll look forward to receiving them and eventually delivering some of your own. One of the rare perks I don't see often in other organizations will be my one-on-one weekly sessions with our Managers and Team Leads. These sessions have been truly critical in removing my learning roadblocks and accelerating my growth at HubSpot. The icing on the cake is the free books program and annual tuition reimbursement of $5k available to us to spend on educating ourselves. Overall, I'm just extremely grateful to be in an organization that values our personal growth and development - putting in place all they can to help us become the best versions of ourselves.
 
My last and favourite perk at HubSpot. I can unequivocally say that it's going to be the people I work with. It's one thing to read about a set of values that a company say it will uphold and one thing to see them truly lived out by everyone day in and day out. At HubSpot, it's the latter - I've seen how each and everyone I've come across has lived the ""HEART"" values out and it's such a privilege to come to work some of the smartest, knowledgeable, humble folks I've known. The resolve to solve for our customer is really infectious. It's really inspiring to see people who are trying to become the best versions of themselves and in turn if motivates yourself.  Also, I've never seen a company so happy for people who are leaving the company for further pursuits. Someone once said, ""A good measure of a company is how they treat those who are leaving."" and I think we rank pretty high in that regard.

We have great vision and plans in the coming few years. Although I can't divulge much, I'm really excited about our growth in the coming years. 

I guess this my dream company to work for. So you can say that I'm living my dream now!"	"The following may not be con per se but they're definitely areas of concern for some people:

- There are really high standards and a really steep learning curve. For some, it might be too metric-driven at times. Therefore, the intensity of the roles might not be for everyone. There's a high chance for burnouts. That said,  the management has tried to improve this with health-related workshops (sleep, posture and nutrition), providing a meditation room, building a safe space and enhancing psychological safety.
- It's an extremely fast-changing environment. SingSpot operates a little like its own startup and it's a bit of a double-edged sword. While we're agile and adaptable, we can get a little disorienting for some. We don't have a lot of policies so typically you'll hear UGJ (Use good judgment) but that can have differing interpretations. Some see this as empowerment, trust and autonomy but some view it as a lack of guidelines. To each his own, I personally love it but a little more processes/systems and playbooks wouldn't harm.
- We're also not as well-known in APAC and in Singapore as compared to HubSpot in other markets. So you might find yourself trying to even spell out ""HubSpot"" for some customers. I personally find that really exciting that we're in the process of making ourselves better known in the region.

Some other areas for improvement
KPI 
- Some of the metrics connected to performance used in this region may not be the most reflective of an employee's ability and can become customer roadblocks. They can be majorly swayed by cultural perceptions of scoring. 

Product
- While I love the frequent product updates, we can improve the way they're shared.
- Product adaptation to meet regional expansion goals can be enhanced. On the product front, more localisation and more language support are very much welcomed, especially in the APAC region. We're trailing behind in terms of mobile play and eCommerce play. 
- The ideas in the HubSpot Ideas Forum can be worked on more actively (especially those with more than 150 upvotes over an extended period of time).

Career Development 
- Availability of certain roles in other regions may not be available in SingSpot, especially for more product-oriented and niche roles. However, internal mobility is great! 

Strategy 
- The playbook for certain markets such as India and some other Southeast Asian markets is still in its early stages and strategies from North America might not be as applicable. 

Cross-Collaboration
- Cross collaboration/function can be improved - introduce more projects that require the involvement of 2 different functions

Diversity, Belonging and Inclusion
- Even though we are rather diverse in nationalities and ethnicity but we can be more conscious in embracing inclusivity and belonging. Comparing SingSpot to other offices, advocacy in LGBTQ isn't as strong. Also, the choice of restaurants and food preferences during social events can take more into consideration of Muslims, Vegetarians and Vegans.  
- Also, we have quite a skewed ""younger"" group of workers  (mostly millennials) and the balance of some more senior workers could be useful for us. 

Giving Back 
- We can be more environmentally conscious - more conscious with choice of food vendors and in encouraging the use of own reusable cutlery.
- We can also give back more to the community in Singapore e.g. Blood Donation Drive, Community Events and helping the elderly etc.

Just a caveat here, no company is perfect and some of these are present in most companies of our nature (SaaS company, mid/large scale and trying to localise). These are simply things I hope we can improve on but I would still like to highlight that it's still one of the best companies I've worked for. This is so especially so when I’ve worked already for a few companies prior to HubSpot."
35	Diverse and Inclusive Work Environment	 Anonymous Employee	20 Oct 2019	5.0	HubSpot has always made me feel welcome and included right from the very first interview I had with them. Joining the company has just shown how much effort has been put in to ensure this is an inclusive and accepting workplace. From the trust the company puts in their employees to the amazing benefits, I could not ask for a better place to work at.	There could be more improvements made around career growth.
36	Sales	 Sales	18 Oct 2019	5.0	Treated like adults, Vacation Quota Relief, unlimited leave, strong share options, no capped commission. You also have the opportunity to have a seat at the table. If there is a challenge that needs to be addressed or goal that needs to be achieved and you feel you can add value in that context, senior management are open and humble enough to let you try and drive the required changes.	Quite a lefty company. Can be a bit much sometimes.
37	Working at HubSpot is both a challenging and rewarding experience	 Customer Support Specialist	17 Oct 2019	5.0	The people and the culture of HEART - nothing gimmicky about it! Unlimited leave/vacation is my favourite perk! Plus, the health and wellness benefits are awesome because it allows you to take care of yourself and essentially you can bring your best self forward :)	Super fast-paced! Everything changes quickly so you are expected to adapt and learn on the go. Expectations are high so not breaking under pressure is important.
38	It's a amazing place to grow better, period!!	 Sales	17 Oct 2019	5.0	"- Great like-minded folks around
- Leadership is transparent about in and out of the company
- Great vacation and health benefits
- Autonomy at it's best
- Employees wellness is actually well looked after
- There's never enough to learn it all - you cannot stop learning at Hubspot"	"- Need more core growth roles in APAC
- Should involve individual contributor roles into decision making; esp when those teams are small / just individuals and spread across the globe"
39	Great place to work	 Anonymous Employee	15 Oct 2019	4.0	"- Great people
- Great benefits and flexibility 
- Continuously growing and the organisation truly cares about 'growing better'"	- Change management could be improved
40	HubSpot Review	 Igs	14 Oct 2019	5.0	Open culture, good interview process, very helpful employees, structured process, clear-cut matrix for measuring and improving performance	India strategy still shaping up
41	Great place to work	 Anonymous Employee	8 Oct 2019	4.0	Great company culture. Excellent perks. Heavily promotes learning and self-development i.e. free books programme, annual tuition grant to take courses etc. I also appreciate's management's commitment to diversity and inclusion - truly feel that I can be my authentic self at work.	Work can feel very siloed - you work on your own set of prospects/ customers/ projects. Not necessarily a bad thing as you are then accountable for your own success. As other reviewers have pointed out, internal mobility is also a challenge.
42	A company with an empowering culture that focuses on you	 Customer Support Specialist	2 Oct 2019	5.0	HubSpot values learning and growing - and it practices what it preaches. As a HubSpotter, I have always felt like my job was being valued. Additionally, It's surprising to see how the leadership focuses a lot on the personal development of all employees, and I see myself growing as much as I want to in HubSpot. Never want to leave this place!	"The company is growing  rapidly and is naturally prone to many cons of a normal ""entreprise"", so the next few years is going to be an important period as much as it would volatile and unpredicted."
43	Love working at HubSpot	 Sales Representative	29 Sep 2019	5.0	"The perks are great. 
Management team is raising the bar. The MD is approachable, transparent and always there for the team. I have not seen this kind of leadership ever. There is a big vision set and he is driving the team towards that. I feel it is a good mix of high performance with a fun environment."	We can do more to help the community here in Singapore. We do a few events but can do more on a regular basis
44	Great benefits, weak leadership.	 Anonymous Employee	25 Sep 2019	2.0	Benefits are unparalleled - good compensation, excellent medical coverage and unlimited vacation.	Leadership is out of touch and sorely lacking in transparency. MD makes the sales team do this insane 'blood commit' (it's actually on their calendars) where reps commit a number - with their blood. Not sure why no one in the leadership team has said anything about it.
45	Great company, but few opportunities for internal mobility in Singapore	 Customer Support Specialist	12 Sep 2019	4.0	"- Great benefits!! Fair pay
- Great people and managers
- HEART is really a thing – people really are Humble, Empathetic, Adaptable, Remarkable and Transparent. My favorite part of all is the Transparency – it's radical, makes it easy for you to get stuff done and builds trust 
- Great culture
- Awesome pantry
- Fast paced environment – I like this so it's a pro for me. We move really fast and try very hard not to break things. 1 year here is like 3 years in another company, you get to learn and grow quickly, as long as you can keep pace 
- Psychological safety is a thing, people care about it and about you"	"Internal mobility is really hard in Singapore because it's a smaller office with less roles. Many of the cool roles are only available in Cambridge (HQ) or Dublin. 

Sucks because it's an office where you have a lot of talented and hardworking people early in their careers (especially in the Support team), who are dying to learn more and build their knowledge and skills. There are many who are pretty tenured and keep working hard but it's extremely demoralizing when we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel (i.e. roles that we can see ourselves moving on to)"
46	Great place to work, moves really fast	 Anonymous Employee	11 Sep 2019	5.0	"- Great benefits - unlimited leave, amazing medical coverage, employee development, free books
- A lot of autonomy given at work. Flexible hours and ability to work from home
- The People. My manager is amazing, I have so much to learn from him. And my team is also great to work with."	Product changes constantly, so everything moves at a very fast pace. You are expected to be able to keep up with it on your own, don't expect to be spoonfed. Might not be suitable for someone who doesn't thrive in such fast paced environments.
47	An amazing company and software, albeit struggling to make a difference in Asia	 Service Organization	11 Sep 2019	3.0	"This is a review of the Singapore branch:

HubSpot is an excellent company with lots of positive attributes. While compensation in the service organization is not overly competitive, the training and exposure received are worth the effort. Perks are generous, and a high degree of flexibility is offered to employees, such as working from home or unlimited leave (although these are often abused in this region). The product is definitely one of the best CRM / Sales / Marketing automation tools globally for Small and Mid Market companies (although very US-centric - significant improvement could be made on regional adaptation)"	"- If you already possess good knowledge about Digital Marketing / Automation / Sales processes as you enter the company, you will likely hit the ceiling quickly as the majority of clients are small businesses that are unsophisticated in their use of technology.
- Most managers are inexperienced and would tend to repeat mistakes. That includes things such as not taking actions on low performances, constantly asking subordinates on what should be done and lacking rigorous standards to help team members grow their skillset.
- Leadership is generally not knowledgeable about our product and competitive landscape (lack of technical knowledge and business acumen). It makes it difficult for them to evaluate the resources they need or differentiate between top performers and those requiring improvement.
- In Singapore, the perks granted are often being abused. However, little to no actions are taken by management to enforce more discipline.
- As most staff is below 30 (average age around 27 years old), you rarely feel challenged by more senior co-workers.
- While the Software is great and globally competitive, there is almost no plan to adapt the product roadmap and processes to Asia (SEA/India). As a result, growth in this high potential region has somewhat been disappointing."
48	Fast-paced, independent, transparent	 Anonymous Employee	10 Sep 2019	5.0	"- Smart, highly-motivated colleagues who take ownership of their work and are proud of what they do
- Friendly, humane environment where everyone looks out for each other
- Big emphasis on learning and personal development
- Management is committed to connecting with team members on a personal and intrinsic level
- The benefits are really not bad at all! You really do have peace of mind knowing that your insurance that covers almost every medical risk you can anticipate as a regular adult."	"- Emphasis on individual ownership and independence at times bristles against Management objectives and pressure to conform to high standards
- The constant changes to the product can make it challenging to keep up
- Strong emphasis on feedback and honesty can be quite intimidating for some, especially those who are less culturally inclined to talking back or being frank with team members and superiors"
49	Awesome place to work!	 Customer Onboarding Specialist	1 Sep 2019	5.0	It is a company with a great culture, co-workers, managers and (of course) benefits!  The company truly empathises with its employees and creates an environment where it allows us to perform to the best of our capabilities and at the same time maintain a great work-life balance.  For example, I had great support throughout my pregnancy and was able to have alternative work arrangements when needed. This enabled me to enjoy the best of both worlds!	It is a fast-moving company, things are dynamic and priorities change. It is important to have a growth mindset that motivates you to learn and adapt so it may not be for everyone.
50	Best company I've worked for so far	 Anonymous Employee	29 Aug 2019	5.0	The culture is unparalleled - supportive teammates, flexibility in working arrangements, respect for time off, ability to achieve 'work-life fit', free books and excellent health benefits. More than this, I appreciate how most people are willing to give and receive honest feedback. Expectations are high at HubSpot, but that's because we expect everyone to strive for excellence and perform at our best.	The Singapore office is still young and growing fast, so some processes haven't quite been figured out yet.  Not all strategies from HQ in North America are directly applicable to the APAC market, so there's some work to be done in localising the business here.
51	Great place to work, but not for everyone	 Anonymous Employee	29 Aug 2019	5.0	Encourage to stay out of the comfort zone constantly.	Over estimate the forecast, and hire too much people.
52	Best Company To Work For!	 People Operations	26 Aug 2019	5.0	"THE PEOPLE! 
You are almost 100% guaranteed that you'll be working alongside with people who are amazing at what they do. 

THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES!
This is a company that truly cares about the employees and wanting the employees to grow and develop both professionally and personally. Lots of developmental programs, initiatives and opportunities to learn from others. E.g. 5K SGD tuition reimbursement grant per annum for everyone, free books programs, e-learning platforms, master class, internal wiki, the list goes on… 
THE AUTONOMY AND FLEXIBILITY!
Employees are trusted and given the autonomy to be at their best. E.g I work more efficiently and effectively at home and I had the flexibility to work from home whenever needed without providing justification. (This may subjected to the team due to the nature of your work)

THE BENEFITS
A company that takes care of the employees, amazing benefits! Eg. Unlimited leave, I took 30 days last year (The guideline here is to USE GOOD JUDGEMENT). Unlimited TCM, maternity coverage, awesome medication coverage where your dependents will be covered too"	Not that I can think of now.
53	Why joining HubSpot is even better than an MBA	 Anonymous Employee	24 Aug 2019	5.0	"There are many reasons why HubSpot is the place to go work for. A lot of tech companies use frills like very attractive perks and benefits (modern designed offices, unlimited vacation, great insurance coverages, parents benefits and many more, we get the drift) and dangle in your face. I think that's besides the point why. 

People leave a workplace (no matter how nice everything else is) if they do not feel secure, have a poor manager, or does not believe in the management of the company. 

Let me illustrate how HubSpot has well thought out systems and teams to protect against that disenchantment that attrition is real if none of the above is met. 

1. Feeling secure
The day that you join HubSpot, regardless of team / role / title, you go through an onboarding program that is world-class. Everyone will learn about the product, and everyone needs to do an intensive project that will put one in a potential customer's shoes - learning how to actually use HubSpot's platform. Having gone through 3 months of onboarding led by the Learning and Development team, you basically are left with very little chance of failing in your role. Learning doesn't stop when onboarding ends. HubSpot really believes in investing in employee development, because if you do a quick search, you'd come to the realisation (as did we) that the cost of hiring a replacement and re-training far outweighs the cost of ensuring that employees are able to adapt and keep themselves upskilled for tomorrow's job. Everytime there is a new significant product change / launch, every customer-facing team (Sales, Services, Support) undergoes training to ensure we know how to talk about it, sell it, and teach customers to use it. Besides internal trainings that are required, HubSpot also believes that when you are upskilled, you also become a more valuable employee to the company. We have a very generous annual tuition grant of S$6750/year for accredited courses, and a discretionary budget for any employee development course, as long as you know that this will help you get ahead in your career. I've since used the budget to take online courses from Harvard Business, Stanford Centre of Professional Development, and other SEO-related courses to enhance my knowledge. We also have our internal Learning Management System called Learn@HubSpot, and these are all FREE to take. There are particularly interesting ones like ""Communicating Effectively With Executives"", ""Why Is Internal Mobility"", ""Working from Home Etiquette"" to job-specific skills like ""Intro to API"", ""Google Ads Advanced Training"" etc. With so many resources available to ensure that you are successful, if anyone complains that they feel they are not progressing, it's really on them to take the initiative to grow, and not just grow, but grow better. I know that all these don't just benefit my role today at HubSpot, but also prepares me for any future endeavours I wish to pursue in the future. If anything, HubSpot allows me to feel like I've stood on the shoulders of giants to accomplish what I have.

2. Great managers
It is not possible to have perfect managers at any company. The realistic and pragmatic expectation is how best we manage a poor-performing manager, and ensure that others have the chance to grow and become a great manager. I am an individual contributor, and I have seen my fair share, and worked with amazing managers at HubSpot. These are individuals who care greatly about the success of their team and solve for their team. Everyone at HubSpot lives by the motto of ""Solving for the Customer"", now, our managers live by the motto of ""Solving for the team"". Their main job is to remove any obstacles that prevents individual contributors from performing and excelling, and then let them do their magic. Of course, not all managers are amazing, but there are feedback channels available to surface this to management. It is on the management to ensure that poor managers are trained, and if not, let go, in order to not harm the entire team. I've seen senior managers in very highly visible positions get let go because their performance is just not up to par. It sends a huge message that when the team is not performing, it's usually because the manager isn't managing well, and we are not afraid to make hard decisions when needed.
Usually such decisions are made in the HQ, because these are also the managers who have the greatest impact to either hurt progress, or forge progress. 

3.  Believing in the management of HubSpot
This is my number one reason aside from the rest why I think working in HubSpot beats going for any MBA program. The executive leadership team is highly transparent. We are talking about 80 pages business strategy memos written by senior leaders that are shared to everyone in the company. There are HELMs (HubSpot Executive Leadership Meetings) and various board meeting decks being shared. Essentially, if anyone who has poor judgement and wants to screw HubSpot over with divulging such information, can. But most don't, and won't. When you are given a lot of information and responsibility to protect HubSpot's future, you tend to act in the best interest of the company. I think this is something that many tech companies say they are transparent, but don't act as they do. All our leaders are also available through Slack, and you can literally just reach out to any senior leaders and ask them anything. I recall having to get some information from our CPO (Chief People Officer) Katie Burke, and she responded to me within a couple hours. I'm based in Singapore, and I have access to our top management in the US, in such proximity. Imagine how powerful that can be in a 2,600 strong company. For the most part, when we say we want to do something, and set it as a company goal, we usually do it, and make bets on it. I've seen how my own role has transformed since the last 1.5 years because of the nature of the development of HubSpot. As we started from a Marketing software company, we have now grown into a platform company. My KPIs have evolved to align with the progress of the business, and everyone is very agile in ensuring that we keep acting and delivering to evolve the company. Our COO strongly believes in HubSpot being big and fast, and I think we are getting there."	It's not all a bed of roses at HubSpot. But when you think of any cons and weigh it against the pros, any reasonable and logical person will be grateful and be counting their blessings of just how lucky being a HubSpotter really is. I remind myself to not take things for granted because of petty trivial things that as with time, this too shall pass.
54	Inbound Growth Specialist (Account Executive)	 Inbound Growth Specialist	23 Aug 2019	4.0	"This is a review for the Singapore office:

values & work life balance
- transparency of management - one of the most transparent company I've ever worked for
- feedback culture - everyone including MD encouraged to give and receive feedback
- genuinely nice people who work here 
- flexibility and unlimited holidays - (however many people abuse this privilege)
- an international hub with people from all countries 

career advancement and opportunity
- still a small hub within a big market (Asia + India) so lots of potential and opportunities to learn
- a global company so lots of opportunity for internal mobility"	"- leadership outside of Singapore office is great, Singapore office leadership is lacking, they promote from within and managers lack experience (ie. don't know how to forecast, keep team accountable)
- surrounded by lots of new grads who lack business acumen - lack of talent here to learn from
- global internal processes still need work and causing lots of friction for sales reps to sell
- give out trophies for everything"
55	Great Place to learn & work	 Anonymous Employee	22 Aug 2019	5.0	"APAC Leadership team is committed and transparent
Great perks
Culture"	None which I can think of
56	Customer Support	 Anonymous Employee	22 Aug 2019	5.0	"Being in HubSpot for a few years now, I feel like I've gotten to know the company a lot better. Even then, I only have good things to say about the people that I work with, the values of the company, how management truely lives up to the standards we promote as part of ""HubSpot culture"". 
Of course no company is perfect, but having experienced a few other roles in my career, I can truely appreciate how happy I am working here."	Can't really think of cons at the moment.
57	Probably the best company I've worked for	 Anonymous Employee	22 Aug 2019	5.0	HubSpot Singapore is a great place if you're starting out your career. Employee onboarding is very well thought-out and managers and team mates are transparent and supportive. If you're more senior and looking to build on your leadership experience, this is the place to be. Forget about titles for a while and you'll realise the exposure you get is really good. As HubSpot Singapore grows, you get to collaborate with different leaders in teh region or even globally to help solve complex problems and truly get a chance to build something special. Company is pretty flat, which makes localised plays easy to execute. Flexible working hours make it easy for people with other life commitments like kids, etc.	Not really a con, but the pace can be blistering fast. So you'll need to be able to get used to the pace.
58	Transparent, thoughtful, challenging	 Anonymous Employee	16 Aug 2019	5.0	"Company does its best to stick to its HEART values. Transparency especially. Management doesn't hide anything from the teams, openly shares stats and results even during periods where things aren't amazing.  There is a lot of effort to be thoughtful and inclusive. 

The business as a whole is also doing well, so it is a good experience to see what it is like working for a global company that is going through a growth phase, even when it's alrady quite large.

There are a lot of challenges working in Asia, there are definitely some things that don't go smoothly, but the ones that thrive here are the ones who understand that and want to help solve those new problems that global teams or HQ hasnt solved yet."	"Company says it wants to be ""global first"" but is still quite a long way from getting there. I think we are getting better at recognizing that HubSpot operates in many countries, and so we are more and more international from that sense, but our operations and our systems are still very much USA centric and it's a frustration for a lot of regional teams."
59	Provides the stability of a big company with the fast-paced environment of a start-up	 Anonymous Employee	15 Aug 2019	5.0	"-Best of class leadership team, their clarity of vision is a daily inspiration.
-Hyper growth mode, there's always something new to learn or a problem to solve.
-Supportive environment for autonomous and flexible work.
-Perks are great (unlimited vacation, stock options, FREE books) but it's really working with some of the smartest and inclusive colleagues that's the greatest perk of being at HubSpot."	"You'll have to keep explaining to the uninitiated what HubSpot is, it's not as easy as ""Oh I work at Google or Facebook""."
60	Sometimes it still feels too good to be true to be working here	 Anonymous Employee	14 Aug 2019	5.0	"Smart people who care
Managers who nurture and not dictate
Challenging work
Huge growth opportunities
Above-average pay grade for fresh graduates
Transparent culture
Additional benefits are pretty sick too"	"Lots of changes, you need to be highly adaptable
Growing company = more competition when comes to certain positions but could serve as a motivation for personal and career growth"
61	The best company I've worked at, out of the 6 companies in my career	 Anonymous Employee	14 Aug 2019	5.0	"- Company really, really cares about you. They aren't lying when they say they care about your progress and your experience, a lot of the processes are structured to understand how you feel and they will push you to grow 
- At least in APAC, pay is rather competitive. It's not the top of the industry from what I know, but compared to many others in a cheap labour market in this region it's good 
- Benefits are UNREAL. So good! Medical insurance is super comprehensive, and unlike other companies people and managers genuinely encourage you to take your unlimited leave. + the amazing food and events make things all the better 
- The people! Most managers (90% from my experience) and directors have 0 airs to them. So willing to talk and help each other out. I came from many other firms where higher ups were more than eager to make everyone else do their dirty work, here management works alongside you and does the work with you. I've had the Senior VP, Managing Director, International - Jeetu memorise virtually everyone's names and he would personally address any of our questions, professional or personal
- Most colleagues are so willing to share and help. There are exceptions naturally, but no one I've met in all my time here is malicious, which in itself is a miracle to me. For context, I am a massive, massive pessimist. I was convinced every firm would be out there to squeeze you dry and you do the same. But the people here in HubSpot have proven to me that your colleagues can truly push you to become a better person.  
- The work is rewarding. I've met real customers who have expressed gratitude that we have helped them grow better as a business 
- So much autonomy! Many of my previous companies would tout that they are ""forward looking"" and ""flexible"" but reality was employees were staying till 10pm. HubSpot gives me the autonomy to work from home (even in APAC! which is huge!) and so long as I deliver, there is flexibility.  
- Huge, huge pro to me personally : the facilities. All your equipment is brand new when you first come in. The office isn't an open office which is incredibly not conducive as proven by multiple studies. Really empowers you to work better"	"- Processes in APAC are not optimised at the moment, there are many things internally we could work on to be more efficient and to avoid less grey area. 
- As a US-based company, it can be very challenging to work with APAC's cultural and buying behavioural differences. We're still working on localisation, I think we still have quite a long way to go in thinking global but acting local 
- Everything moves incredibly fast, sometimes too fast. The product evolves so much that even customers can get tripped up , and employees often have to bear that frustration with customers. If you're someone who doesn't like fast moving industries, this is certainly not a company for you."
62	One of the best companies I have worked at	 Marketing Manager	14 Aug 2019	5.0	HubSpot is definitely one of the best companies I have worked at. The culture is amazing and the employees are even better. The salary and benefits are above market standards. A really good product and a great leadership team are the key for it's rapid growth in a cluttered market. Proud to be part of this organization.	Nothing specific to mention. All good
63	The perfect place for exponential personal and career growth	 Marketing Manager	14 Aug 2019	5.0	"- Plenty of opportunities to do impactful work.
- The culture is great, one filled with lots of trust and empathy. 
- Very friendly work environment filled with like-minded individuals who build each other up."	"- Not the best place for someone who is unable to juggle flexibility and high output volume. 
- Like many other companies of this size, expect to have a different work environment and leadership experience based on the team you're on."
64	A Place to Learn and Grow	 Anonymous Employee	13 Aug 2019	5.0	"-Culture: I remember reading HubSpot's Culture Code when I was going through the interview process. I thought it sounded nice and aspirational (as it is with most businesses). Upon joining, I was surprised to find that HubSpot really ""walks the walk"" when it comes to culture. And it's not just about ping pong tables and beer taps; it's about all of us creating a place where we can do our best work
-Training: I went through a month of training before I was ever expected to deliver anything. That's true of most roles at HubSpot. They really want to make sure that each person is set up for success. And the learning has continued throughout my journey (over two years now)
-Flexibility: We are encouraged to work ""wherever, whenever, and however"" we want. Of course there are limits, but I love that HubSpot treats us like adults and hold us accountable for the output more than the input. I personally work from home one day each week
-Remarkable people: HubSpot is serious about its recruitment and it shows. I have the pleasure of working with some of the smartest, most creative, most genuine people of my career here at HubSpot
-Career growth: HubSpot is growing quickly and that means more opportunity for everyone. For me that means growing my skills and contributing more back to the business. But it's also meant that I've been promoted twice in two years
-Benefits: Where to start? Unlimited time off, free books program, tuition reimbursement, excellent health insurance... the benefits are many"	This is specific to APAC, but because we're so small (compared to the US) and growing so quickly, that means some of us have to take on extra responsibilities outside of our core roles. It's a double-edged sword though, as it's a great opportunity to stretch ourselves in meaningful ways.
65	Great Place to Work!	 Anonymous Employee	6 Jul 2019	5.0	Senior leadership and management is transparent and actions on feedback. Get to work with high performing teams and talented co-workers. The company's mission is to help millions of organizations grow better, but at the same time, the company is also actively helping its employees to grow better.	Things evolve and change at a rapid pace, as expected of a growing SaaS company, so there is a need to constantly stay on the edge and keep up with the latest information.
66	best place i have worked in so far	 Sales	8 Oct 2018	5.0	"great employee benefits, constantly reviewing themselves to make sure employees are happy
awesome work culture, everyone is happy and loves working here"	young middle management still needs to be trained and honed more but still very promising
67	Great personal and career development	 Customer Success Manager	2 Jun 2018	5.0	"- Incredible pace at product development and innovation, I've not seen a tech company until HubSpot that has product sprints going out on a DAILY basis. [Super important for any tech company to be ahead of the curve and thinking about setting the industry benchmark for what's next]

- Everything is in the Wiki. From the latest marketing experiments (which in my opinion, are pieces written 10x better than any you'd find on growthhackers.com), to the Management team's targets, focus, thoughts, and priorities. I can spend hours going down the rabbit hole in this encyclopedia of knowledge from the smartest people globally. There's best practices and playbooks all documented, learnings and experiences from individuals who've been there done that, that we recently needed to have someone's full time job as a Wiki Manager to organise this world of information.

- Culture. From projects working on diversity and inclusion, to ensuring that there are plentiful employee engagement activities, there's a lot of activities planned, if only you have time, bother to attend, show up, and engage in them.

- Learning. This spans not just your own job scope, but also personal development, and future career growth. There are just so much resources available to tap on, like taking Managerial lessons if you intend to be a Manager one day, to attending workshops like becoming a trusted advisor. Seriously, it doesn't get better than this. There's $5k tuition grant and a free Kindle books program. HubSpot really invests A LOT in educating employees to be the smartest of the lot. 

If you are looking for somewhere to stand, HubSpot is a giant. Anyone driven enough is invited to stand on its shoulders to look further than what one can on him/herself."	One of the biggest cons of a big company is that there are cliques and silos formed within teams. Humans tend to gravitate toward similar people with similar experiences. One of the ways we deal with that is to play musical chairs and physically move people around at their desks so different teams get to be near each other.
68	Positive onboarding and ramping up process	 Channel Consultant	27 Nov 2017	5.0	Great people, organized onboarding, well structured job role, good benefits.	Haven't found them yet! Although no company's perfect, HubSpot seems to be trying pretty hard to get as close as it can.
69	Find peace past the kool-aid	 Anonymous Employee	21 Jun 2017	5.0	"- Flexibility with working hours. As long as you get your job done, no one bats an eyelid at what time you're online
- Great level of autonomy with projects and day-to-day
- Good compensation (for Singapore)
- Lots of learning opportunities
- Cross-department interaction is strong and always highly encouraged"	"- Requires a great level of self-direction (can be a pro, too). Some colleagues struggle with this in terms of career growth or when they face ambiguous questions with no clear-cut questions
- Dynamic and constant learning can be a tiring (can be a pro, too)
- Strong sales culture, very cult-like, so some people may find the energy level quite disruptive
- Some Product teams are messy, so morale is affected"
70	great	 SDR	4 May 2017	5.0	compassionate, supportive, path for growth	competitive, rigorous, not many more
71	Exciting company to work for you are looking for personal growth	 Channel Account Executive	30 Mar 2017	5.0	"HubSpot is a dynamic company in a fast-growing technology segment. The company never sits still and you can sense that the excitement through the constant new products and features being launched. And the management never flinches from making bold decisions that has a major impact on the entire company.

One of the great perks in working in HubSpot is that you are surrounded by some of the smartest people in the industry. More importantly, because of the transparency in the company (particularly through the internal wiki), you can understand the thoughts and debates behind many important decisions made in the company. That makes it for a great learning experience if you are willing to invest your time and energy.

On the sales team, there is a strong structure and data-driven process around it. I feel HubSpot is a great place for a salesperson to start their career (especially if they want to build a career in tech sales) as they learn so much, not just learning from more senior colleagues, but also from learning the process."	The constant changes, while mostly positive and much needed for the company as a whole, can take its toll on individuals. On the sales side of things, the changes can impact your ability to do your job but you still need to hit your quota so there is a lot of adapting needed. It's probably not so much a con but a challenge that comes with working for a company like HubSpot.
72	Great company culture. Start-up mentality with customer-centric approach. Two thumbs up!	 Anonymous Employee	15 May 2016	5.0	Incredible growth opportunities for individual contributors. Proper mentoring and continuous feedback to set employees for success. Transparent and positive working culture to keep employees engaged and motivated to achieve more. Did I forget to mention about our unlimited vacations policy? No complaints thus far!	The bar is set very high and everyone is expected to either meet or exceed expectations. A lot of emphasis on achieving results which are clearly defined on a quarterly basis.
73	Want to feel humiliated and belittled? If yes, it is perfect for you!	 	12 Mar 2016	2.0	Great product and they practice their culture code well in their HQ. Great coworkers in HQ and If you join their new team, they will treat you really well during your new hire training..	"For a company that heavily prides itself on culture, humility and transparency, none of these were brought onto their Singapore office. 

1) You will be told to ask for help when needed, but you will then be shamed for needing help

You will ALWAYS be told to ""ask for help or questions"" and that you would be provided support, but when an employee bravely asked for help on things they were not certain on to help them in their role, is it ""support"" to be shamed by the management for not knowing it? Shamed and belittled for voicing out, by the same people that were hired to lead and support the team?


2) Even if you hadn't applied for the job but they had reached out to you, they will interview you, look at your CV, offer you the role after several rounds of interviews and hire you. Then they will tell you you are ""inexperienced to work with them""

Is it good leadership to constantly tell an employee repeatedly that they are ""very inexperience and it is clear that they need to face more of different situations for them to get the experience"" but then not providing them the support? If they had thought of an employee as inexperienced, why would they hire the person in the first place, and then only give them 3 months to prove to be exceptional in the role?

Additionally, don't be surprised if they also belittle you by saying that your ""English and Communication skills are very poor"".

These comments come from the same people who hired you. Your confidence will be chipped away daily.


3) If you are a local with expertise in the region, they will hire you as a ""local face"" and also to be someone who can help the company find a middle ground between the local business culture and their American practices. But once you're hired, don't expect the management to want to listen to your feedback. 

During my tenure, the local/expat Management were adamant of having a ""we have tried, tested and proven results for these in the US & Aus, Hence, it would work in the Asia region and you should just follow what is told"" mentality.  Is this really how you want to Solve For The Customer? 

4) Want to know what your progress is like and where you stand in the company? Don't bother asking the management. They will tell you things to deceive you so you would trust them, and then next thing you know, they're done with you. Transparency level = Opaque


5) Your understanding of your jobscope & skill sets needed, your global co-workers in the same roleas understanding, and the local management's expectations of your role will be extremely misaligned. So be quite prepared to be confused and ""inexperienced"".


6) Understand the features of the products but need more help with explaining them more succinctly? You can ask for help with fellow co-workers and even request for some time to do product training. 

But don't be surprised that as per Point #1, you will be shamed by the management for being transparent about the help you need and they will spin a story telling other employees that you do not know even the bare minimum. Yet somehow, you passed your New Hire Training. 


7) If the company is done with you and you resign on the same day, they will pay you to leave immediately, treat you like a criminal, humiliate you by saying you are not allowed back in the office to pack their own things, like a Bank's retrenchment.


8) For a company that prides themselves on hearing feedback, when an exit interview was requested, it was immediately refused. It required me to go up to the upper management before I was provided one. 


These were only the few out of many bad experiences I've had with the company; more specifically, the management here in Singapore. It is fine that the company felt that I was not a good fit, but it was absolutely uncalled for to treat someone with such hostility and humiliation.  It has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth, and also for the current employees to see how I was mistreated. 


SUMMARY: My whole time with the company since I returned from their New Hire Training in Boston was handled extremely poorly. Let's just say that for a company who prides themselves on a ""great culture (code)"" and a ""no-jerk"" policy, they did not carry that over from their HQ to their other offices (in this case, Singapore)."
